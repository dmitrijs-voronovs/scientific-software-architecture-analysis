You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it based on the Human-Authorship Principle. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_","

However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer.

18," returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error. Neither in() nor out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from. The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then in() will be called. Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before calling inflateBack(). If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called immediately for input. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1]. The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called. These descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller- supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job. On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call. The return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized. In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning non-zero. (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.","

- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
 returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error. Neither in() nor out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from. The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then in() will be called. Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before calling inflateBack(). If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called immediately for input. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1]. The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called. These descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller- supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job. On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call. The return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized. In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning non-zero. (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.
",False,"The text appears to describe the functionality and usage of a function named inflateBack(). It explains how it works, what inputs are required, and potential error conditions. This is high-value human knowledge about software development concepts (specifically compression) and serves as documentation or explanation for developers. The detailed nature of the description indicates it was written by a human to explain technical details to other humans."

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

3,"A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available: Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either umls or mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams. These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available: Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either umls or mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams. These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended! Parameters ann_index: FloatIndex An nmslib approximate nearest neighbours index. tfidf_vectorizer: TfidfVectorizer The vectorizer used to encode mentions. ann_concept_aliases_list: List[str] A list of strings, mapping the indices used in the ann_i
",False,"This text appears to be a technical explanation and documentation for an entity linking system. It discusses the functionality, configuration options (UMLS and MESH), the use of sklearn.TfidfVectorizer, approximate nearest neighbours index, and potential issues with aliases in the KnowledgeBase.

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.

Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.

- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.

7,"Switch t-SNE in scanpy to openTSNE; I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. Some of these recommendations (learning rate, initialization) are now default in openTSNE. There are some open issues at scanpy related to t-SNE such as https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/1150 and https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/996 but I think this suggestion would supersede them. We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102. I can see four somewhat separate suggestions:. 1. switch scanpy to using openTSNE for tSNE, using already constructed kNN graph. 2. add tSNE support for `ingest` using openTSNE functionality. 3. change default tSNE parameters (n_iter, learning rate, initialization) following openTSNE defaults. 4. add some tSNE recipes based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

11,"ter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
ter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

5,"h is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above. deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read so far (that is, total_in bytes). deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT). In doubt, the data is considered binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect the compression algorithm in any manner. deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
h is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above. deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read so far (that is, total_in bytes). deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT). In doubt, the data is considered binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect the compression algorithm in any manner. deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero). Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and deflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to continue compressing.
",False,"The text appears to be a detailed explanation of the deflate function in compression libraries. It discusses parameters like Z_FULL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH, explains return values (Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END), and describes side effects such as updating adler checksums and data_type fields. This is clearly human-authored documentation explaining how a specific algorithm works to another developer or user. The content addresses the 'why' and 'how' of using deflate with different flush options, which aligns perfectly with Rule 1 for explanations and documentation. There's no indication that this text was generated by a machine; it contains nuanced understanding about edge cases (like ensuring avail_out is greater than six) and standard practices in compression libraries. The absence of any boilerplate language or log formatting confirms its human origin."

",False,"The text appears to be a mix of machine-generated build logs and human communication. However, the primary purpose is human-to-human communication as indicated by the question 'Do you have suggestions?' at the end. The reasoning test passes because it's likely written by a human seeking advice or help in fixing an issue that occurred during compilation. Even though there are many lines of what looks like compiler commands and error messages, these are embedded within a context that suggests interactive communication (e.g., 'Cheers,' which is informal). Therefore, based on the Human-Authorship Principle, this should be kept as it was written by a human to explain an issue and ask for suggestions."

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

However, upon closer inspection, it contains multiple options and their descriptions without clear human-to-human communication context. The content resembles programmatic output (like --help flags) rather than natural language explanations.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.

To make sure it was correct, I also printed out the first value of Allele Depth (""**AD**"") for reference supporting reads. However, it turned out that there was an inconsistent number of reads counted by these two ways. To be more specific, there were more reference supporting reads counted by **ReadSupportAlt** than “**AD**“ did in general. At the very beginning, I thought it was non-alternate-allele reads that made this kind of inconsistent, then I viewed log files. Unfortunately, I found that there were at least 2 more reference supporting reads counted by **ReadSupportAlt** than “**AD**“ did (SNP, min_counts_snps = 2). So I am confused with the result. I would appreciate it if someone help me with this issue.

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.

This function inserts bits in the inflate input stream. The intent is that this function is used to start inflating at a bit position in the middle of a byte. The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used from next_in. This function should only be used with raw inflate, and should be used before the first inflate() call after inflateInit2() or inflateReset(). bits must be less than or equal to 16, and that many of the least significant bits of value will be inserted in the input. If bits is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied. Then inflatePrime() can be called again to put bits in the buffer. This is used to clear out bits leftover after feeding inflate a block description prior to feeding inflate codes. inflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.

However, applying the Human-Authorship Principle: The primary purpose is not human-to-human communication but rather providing operational steps (like a comment on code) that might be intended as documentation. But note Rule 2.1 and the Litmus Test: It's asking to perform an action ('download', 'cache') which makes it sound like machine instructions or comments in code, not natural human explanation. Also, consider if this is boilerplate for software functionality? The text doesn't explain anything; it describes a process that would be implemented via code logic. Therefore, under the Litmus Test and Rule 2 (since it's about system operations), I must eliminate it."

CUI: C5203670, Name: COVID19 (disease). Definition: A viral disorder generally characterized by high FEVER; COUGH; DYSPNEA; CHILLS; PERSISTENT TREMOR; MUSCLE PAIN; HEADACHE; SORE THROAT; a new loss of taste and/or smell (see AGEUSIA and ANOSMIA) and other symptoms of a VIRAL PNEUMONIA. In severe cases, a myriad of coagulopathy associated symptoms often correlating with COVID-19 severity is seen (e.g., BLOOD COAGULATION; THROMBOSIS; ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME; SEIZURES; HEART ATTACK; STROKE; multiple CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS; KIDNEY FAILURE; catastrophic ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODY SYNDROME and/or DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION). In younger patients, rare inflammatory syndromes are sometimes associated with COVID-19 (e.g., atypical KAWASAKI SYNDROME; TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME; pediatric multisystem inflammatory disease; and CYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME). A coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in the genus BETACORONAVIRUS is the causative agent. TUI(s): T047.

It also includes a small bug fix to the abbreviation detector. Note: The models (e.g. `en_core_sci_sm`) are still labeled as version `v0.5.1`, as this release did not involve retraining the base models, only the entity linkers.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |. |- | - | - | - | - | - |. | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |. | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |. | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|. | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |. | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |. | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. deduplication.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

operation with object tables in database
",False,"The phrase 'operation with object tables in database' appears to be a topic or subject line rather than actual content. It does not contain enough context to determine if it was written by a human for explanation or communication, nor is it clearly machine-generated. However, based on the Human-Authorship Principle and Rule 1's requirement that text must explain something to humans, this snippet lacks explanatory substance. Since it doesn't meet the criteria for being human-authored content (explanations, documentation), I would lean towards eliminating it if we consider it as a raw subject line without supporting context. But because there is no clear indication of machine generation or lack of human communication intent in the provided text alone, and given that Rule 1 prioritizes human-communication purpose over grammatical structure, I must apply the litmus test first."

",True,"The text appears to be a technical description or documentation explaining different Zlib flush parameters (Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, etc.). However, upon closer inspection, it does not clearly indicate human authorship. The content is structured like an API documentation or manual page for compression algorithms, detailing the behavior of various settings without any signs of interactive communication or explanation from a human perspective. It contains no questions, answers, or discussions that would suggest human-to-human interaction. Instead, it reads as if it were explaining programming concepts in a formal, instructional manner typical of machine-generated documentation or code comments. The absence of narrative elements and the presence of technical jargon without contextual framing point towards it being an artifact rather than human-authored text."

",True,"This text appears to be an excerpt from a programming language specification or documentation for compiler design. It describes functionality (address-of-label expression) and its default behavior, but lacks explicit human-to-human communication intent. The phrasing is technical and declarative without explanatory elements. Crucially, it resembles standard compiler documentation which often includes machine-generated-like descriptions of features rather than being a direct log or boilerplate. However, the Human-Authorship Principle prioritizes primary origin and purpose: this text was likely written by humans to document language behavior but its form is characteristic of technical specifications that are not primarily for interactive communication between developers. The litmus test fails because it does not appear to be an explanation meant for human understanding in a conversational context, nor does it contain the typical elements of developer discussion (e.g., questions or collaborative problem-solving). Instead, it functions as a machine-generated-like artifact by being part of a formal specification that describes system behavior without engaging in human-to-human dialogue. Therefore, under Rule 2, this is considered a machine-generated artifact because its purpose appears to be functional documentation rather than communication for humans."

",False,"The text appears to be a changelog or release notes for a software project, detailing updates and contributions made by human developers (identified by GitHub usernames). It explains the changes in the codebase, including specific pull requests and actions taken. While it contains technical terms and references to code repositories, its primary purpose is to document and communicate changes to other humans (developers) involved in the project. The presence of explanations about what was changed and why qualifies it as human-authored documentation under Rule 1."

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it based on the Human-Authorship Principle. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Mandate & Litmus Test

Before applying the rules, perform this litmus test: **""Was this text written by a human to explain something to another human?""**
- If the answer is YES, you **MUST KEEP** the text.
- If the answer is NO, it is a machine-generated artifact and **MUST BE ELIMINATED**.

---

### **Rule 1: Content to KEEP (Human-Authored)**
You **MUST KEEP** text if its primary purpose is human-to-human communication. This includes:

1.  **Explanations & Documentation (of ANY length):** Prose that explains *what* something is, *how* it works, or *why* a decision was made.
    *   **CRITICAL:** A short, single-sentence function description (e.g., ""Initializes a checkpoint manager."") is high-value human knowledge and **MUST BE KEPT**.

2.  **Interactive Communication:** Questions, answers, bug reports, and developer discussions.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a log of a terminal session where the vast majority of the text is machine output? If yes, it is a **Log**, not a communication, and **MUST BE ELIMINATED** under Rule 2.1.

3.  **Documentation Containing Code/Data:** Human-written prose that includes code snippets, tables, or lists as examples to support an explanation.

---

### **Rule 2: Content to ELIMINATE (Machine-Generated or Boilerplate)**
You **MUST ELIMINATE** text that is a machine-generated artifact or standard boilerplate.

1.  **Logs, Traces, and Test Reports:** Any output from a program's execution.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Was this text generated *automatically* by a program to report its status? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

2.  **Raw Data Lists:** A list of technical items (e.g., file paths, API names, chemical names) that is **NOT** explained by surrounding human-written sentences.
    *   **Crucial Test:** Is this a table in a README file with a caption? If yes -> **KEEP**. Is it just a raw list of terms or files without an explanatory sentence? If yes -> **ELIMINATE**.

3.  **Boilerplate Notices:** Standard, non-project-specific legal or copyright text.
    *   **Example:** ""Copyright 2017 Google LLC..."" -> **ELIMINATE**.

",True,"This appears to be an instruction or command from a system (e.g., software) rather than human-written communication. It is likely part of a program's output, such as a log message indicating an error state and the need for a reset action. The phrasing 'got a data error' suggests it was generated automatically by a machine to report status during execution or debugging."
