You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

145," cast that I'm missing, or could. Now, There's a lot to unpack here. Let's just stick with my pure subroutine version (not class version) for direct comparison for now. I could pass a structure anyway obviously. Now I can do this, with a TH1F... example 1: . ```cpp. //my_subtrounes.C. // my_subroutines.C. void my_subroutine(shared_ptr<TH1> &x) {. x.reset(); // not needed for TH1F, but safer in general. x.reset(new TH1F());. // .. do something with it. }. ```. ```cpp. //make_th1.C. include <ROOT/RDirectory.hxx> // one extra line ;). ifdef __CINT__. // shared_ptr<TH1> mc_global_x,mc_global_y,mc_global_z; // but saved one line here... endif. void make_th1() {. shared_ptr<TH1> x,y,z;. my_subroutine(x);. my_subroutine(y);. my_subroutine(z);. // and the last we do is leave globals on the heap for interactive user if needed:. ifdef __CINT__ // I wouldn't leave the globals in compiled code. . RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test1"",x); // this line is extra compared to PR, but puts caller in control. RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test2"",y); // but using RDirectory requires 3 lines now ;). RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test3"",z); // . endif. }. ```. I'm ok with this. I like vanilla better, but I got a clean ownership model up until the end here, and made the globals right before exiting, almost like a return statement. If I want to put this in a compiled batch code that loops over this 50 times, pauses 1 second, and displays 3 things each time, I'd just add a loop with sleeps, and Bob's your uncle without even modifying the underlying implementation to get three instances. But this RDirectory version shown here and the C++ global version here are certainly not different in that respect. The C++ globals actually win on line count here if you like this code structure better (I do).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
 cast that I'm missing, or could. Now, There's a lot to unpack here. Let's just stick with my pure subroutine version (not class version) for direct comparison for now. I could pass a structure anyway obviously. Now I can do this, with a TH1F... example 1: . ```cpp. //my_subtrounes.C. // my_subroutines.C. void my_subroutine(shared_ptr<TH1> &x) {. x.reset(); // not needed for TH1F, but safer in general. x.reset(new TH1F());. // .. do something with it. }. ```. ```cpp. //make_th1.C. include <ROOT/RDirectory.hxx> // one extra line ;). ifdef __CINT__. // shared_ptr<TH1> mc_global_x,mc_global_y,mc_global_z; // but saved one line here... endif. void make_th1() {. shared_ptr<TH1> x,y,z;. my_subroutine(x);. my_subroutine(y);. my_subroutine(z);. // and the last we do is leave globals on the heap for interactive user if needed:. ifdef __CINT__ // I wouldn't leave the globals in compiled code. . RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test1"",x); // this line is extra compared to PR, but puts caller in control. RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test2"",y); // but using RDirectory requires 3 lines now ;). RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test3"",z); // . endif. }. ```. I'm ok with this. I like vanilla better, but I got a clean ownership model up until the end here, and made the globals right before exiting, almost like a return statement. If I want to put this in a compiled batch code that loops over this 50 times, pauses 1 second, and displays 3 things each time, I'd just add a loop with sleeps, and Bob's your uncle without even modifying the underlying implementation to get three instances. But this RDirectory version shown here and the C++ global version here are certainly not different in that respect. The C++ globals actually win on line count here if you like this code structure better (I do). I'd argue if one needs the extern header declarations to pass things around in compiled code, he should ask if he's doing it wrong, and that's not an usual sentiment. The whole point is I think to make things vis
",True,"The content appears to be a mix of natural language discussion and technical artifacts (code snippets). However, the primary focus seems to be on comparing code implementations and discussing design choices, but it lacks substantial human-written analysis or explanation. The reasoning provided is mostly about personal preferences ('I'm ok with this', 'I like vanilla better') rather than detailed technical insights. Additionally, there are references to specific C++ constructs (like `shared_ptr` and `RDirectory`) without deep discussion of their implications. While it contains some code examples, the substance does not meet the threshold for meaningful human communication as per the instructions."

While there are some cases where people may want to proceed with this type of data without filtering (like mine e.g. as I am actually working with a curated list of features and not scRNAseq counts) they are scarce and in my opinion sufficiently covered with a warning.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.

The issue was triggered by an inclusion of `<bits/ranges_base.h>` from `string_view`. This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). . It seems the issue is solved by exporting `algorithm` as part of the `string_view` module. ```. Actually, I still don't know why adding `algorithm` fixes a problem with `range_base.h`, so I can't add that to the commit ... maybe it is something like ... by avoiding to use the module map

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

For example, for a matrix, M, of size 3x3,. the data \f$ \left[a_0,a_1,a_2,.......,a_7,a_8 \right] \f$ are stored in the following. order: \f[ M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} a_0 & a_1 & a_2 \\ a_3 & a_4 & a_5 \\ a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \end{array} \right) \f]. 2. ROOT::Math::MatRepSym for a symmetric matrix of size NxN. This class is a template. on the contained type and on the symmetric matrix size, N. It has as data member an. array of type T of size N*(N+1)/2, containing the lower diagonal block of the matrix. The order follows the lower diagonal block, still in a row-major convention. For. example for a symmetric 3x3 matrix the order of the 6 elements. \f$ \left[a_0,a_1.....a_5 \right]\f$ is: \f[ M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} a_0 & a_1 & a_3 \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_4 \\ a_3 & a_4 & a_5 \end{array} \right) \f]. Creating a matrix. The following constructors are available to create a matrix:. * Default constructor for a zero matrix (all elements equal to zero). * Constructor of an identity matrix. * Copy constructor (and assignment) for a matrix with the same representation, or from a. different one when possible, for example from a symmetric to a general matrix. * Constructor (and assignment) from a matrix expression, like D = A*B + C. Due to the. expression template technique, no temporary objects are created in this operation. In. the case of an operation like A = A*B + C, a temporary object is needed and it is created. automatically to store the intermediary result in order to preserve the validity of. this operation. * Constructor from a generic STL-like iterator copying the data referred by the iterator,. following its order. It is both possible to specify the _begin_ and _end_ of the iterator. or the _begin_ and the size. In case of a symmetric matrix, it is required only the. triangular block and the user can specify whether giving a block representing the lower. (default case) or the upper diagonal part. * Constructor of a symmetric matrix NxN passing a ROO

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.
