You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.

 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

**Content to evaluate:**
I successfully ran @zzxuanyuan's version but got benchmarks far from mine, so I got suspicious if I'm seing effects of something else that changed in ROOT (or possibly me having changed the compile options with which I compile ROOT). So I also reran my implementation in @zzxuanyuan's ROOT build (since I use LD_PRELOAD I can override @zzxuanyuan's compression while keeping the entire rest of ROOT). If you compare these new numbers with the previous ones I posted, the RAM consumption went up in general, but it's the same for my implementation and @zzxuanyuan's. I anyhow don't measure the RAM consumption for individual functions and at some point concluded that this is dominated by holding the root file in the memory. | alg -level | compressed size (B) | memory reading (peak, process, B) | memory writing (peak, process, B) | cycles writing (function) | cycles reading (function) |. | --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |. | ZLIB yours | 50704058.000000 | 330447558.000000 | 374567259.000000 | 255700352.000000 | 2443672496 |. | LZ4 yours | 69861890.000000 | 357286997.000000 | 374567259.000000 | 188653871.000000 | 1006741856 |. | ZLIB mine | 50704058.000000 | 327875161.000000 | 371586581.000000 | 255702351.000000 | 2443713877 |. | LZ4 mine | 69874907.000000 | 354320671.000000 | 371586581.000000 | 28579724.000000 | 275698694 |.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

Visualization of marker genes#. Instead of characterizing clusters by known gene markers as previously, we can identify genes that are differentially expressed in the clusters or groups. To identify differentially expressed genes we run sc.tl.rank_genes_groups. This function will take each group of cells and compare the distribution of each gene in a group against the distribution in all other cells not in the group. Here, we will use the original cell labels given by 10x to identify marker genes for those cell types. sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(pbmc, groupby=""clusters"", method=""wilcoxon""). Visualize marker genes using dotplot#. The dotplot visualization is useful to get an overview of the genes that show differential expression. To make the resulting image more compact we will use n_genes=4 to show only the top 4 scoring genes. sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(pbmc, n_genes=4). In order to get a better representation we can plot log fold changes instead of gene expression. Also, we want to focus on genes that have a log fold change >= 3 between the c","

 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

. Heatmaps#. Heatmaps do not collapse cells as in previous plots. Instead, each cells is shown in a row (or column if swap_axes=True). The groupby information can be added and is shown using the same color code found for sc.pl.umap or any other embedding. ax = sc.pl.heatmap(. pbmc, marker_genes_dict, groupby=""clusters"", cmap=""viridis"", dendrogram=True. ). The heatmap can also be plotted on scaled data.

The track plot shows the same information as the heatmap, but, instead of a color scale, the gene expression is represented by height. ax = sc.pl.tracksplot(pbmc, marker_genes_dict, groupby=""clusters"", dendrogram=True). Visualization of marker genes#. Instead of characterizing clusters by known gene markers as previously, we can identify genes that are differentially expressed in the clusters or groups. To identify differentially expressed genes we run sc.tl.rank_genes_groups. This function will take each group of cells and compare the distribution of each gene in a group against the distribution in all other cells not in the group. Here, we will use the original cell labels given by 10x to identify marker genes for those cell types. sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(pbmc, groupby=""clusters"", method=""wilcoxon""). Visualize marker genes using dotplot#. The dotplot visualization is useful to get an overview of the genes that show differential expression. To make the resulting image more compact we will use n_genes=4 to show only the top 4 scoring genes. sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(pbmc, n_genes=4). In order to get a better representation we can plot log fold changes instead of gene expression. Also, we want to focus on genes that have a log fold change >= 3 between the c

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

But the YAML I/O model uses. static typing, so there are limits to how you can use tags with the YAML I/O. model. Recently, we added support to YAML I/O for checking/setting the optional. tag on a map. Using this functionality it is even possible to support different. mappings, as long as they are convertible. To check a tag, inside your mapping() method you can use io.mapTag() to specify. what the tag should be. This will also add that tag when writing yaml. Validation. ----------. Sometimes in a YAML map, each key/value pair is valid, but the combination is. not. This is similar to something having no syntax errors, but still having. semantic errors. To support semantic level checking, YAML I/O allows. an optional ``validate()`` method in a MappingTraits template specialization. When parsing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is call *after* all key/values in. the map have been processed. Any error message returned by the ``validate()``. method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed. When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML. key/values are written. Any error during output will trigger an ``assert()``. because it is a programming error to have invalid struct values. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;. using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {. ... };. template <>. struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {. static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {. ... }. static std::string val","

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**

reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false

**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

    <reasoning>This is an example of keeping criteria. It provides a list of parameters and their values for the `DominatorTree` class, including Eager and Lazy strategies. The content includes technical tags (like `[EAGER]`, `[RF]`) but it's not clear if this was intended to be human-readable or programmatic artifact? Let me check:; - It is a standard commit message format with version control metadata and change descriptions. However, the substance of the natural language text explains two different strategies for multiple updates (Eager and Lazy) and gives a recommendation. The analysis in Example 5 was kept because it provided explanation of design trade-offs despite being embedded within documentation tags. Similarly, this content includes technical commentary on version control metadata that is purely a list of versions with no narrative or detailed discussion about the *reasons* for the changes, so it should be eliminated as it lacks surrounding human analysis or interpretation. However, note that commit messages are often kept if they contain significant natural language and explanation (like Example 5). This content does not provide any such narrative; it is just a list of version numbers and method names without commentary on what was changed or why the changes were made. It's more like a technical artifact than meaningful human discussion, so eliminate this content.</reasoning>

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

 ROOT 7 . . Run the tests . . Setup externals from AFS/CVMFS . . Jenkins . . Doxygen . . Benchmarks . . Contribute . . Collaborate with Us . You are hereHome » Development ROOT 7. For the first time since 20 year (i.e. ever), the ROOT team plans to break backward compatibility for crucial interfaces - once. This new major version of ROOT will make ROOT much simpler and safer to use: we want to increase clarity and usability. If you are a physicist, please read on - this is about your ROOT. The ROOT team will be releasing parts of ROOT 7 throughout the coming years. Previews will gradually sneak into the ROOT sources, in the namespace ROOT::Experimental for those parts that are not yet cast in stone, and in the namespace ROOT for those that are. We will use standard C++ types, standard interface behavior (e.g. with respect to ownership and thread safety), good documentation and tests: we are trying to be nice! Feedback. The main point of the meeting and this page is to solicit your feedback. Most of it has been taken care of in the code already. Building ROOT 7. Pre-requisites. Support for the c++14 standard is required. Usage of g++ &gt;= 5 or clang &gt;= 3.4 is recommended. Relevant cmake variables. The CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD cmake variables must be set to at least 14. Building from source would look similar to this:. $ mkdir root7_build. $ cd root7_build. $ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 path/to/root/source. $ cmake --build . -- -j4. Examples. See the relevant tutorials, for instance for drawing and styling the new histograms. The new interfaces are not about shortening your code - but about robustness. Here are a few examples of what can go wrong with the ROOT6 interfaces:.

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

CPUType is a target-specific value that can be used to. encode the CPU of the target. .. _native object file:. Native Object File Wrapper Format. =================================. Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file. (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object. file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object. formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for. :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode. that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section. predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is. suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful. for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must. be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. . Not all tools support this format.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

Instead of managing the different module versions manually, we can build implicit modules in a given cache path (using ``-fmodules-cache-path``), and reuse them as prebuilt implicit modules by passing ``-fprebuilt-module-path`` and ``-fprebuilt-implicit-modules``. .. code-block:: sh. rm -rf prebuilt; mkdir prebuilt. clang -cc1 -emit-obj -o use.o use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fmodules-cache-path=prebuilt. clang -cc1 -emit-obj -o use.o use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fmodules-cache-path=prebuilt -DENABLE_A. find prebuilt -name *.pcm"". prebuilt/1AYBIGPM8R2GA/A-3L1K4LUA6O31.pcm. prebuilt/1A

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:

Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**

- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**

reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:

The exact guarantees provided depend on the. ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as. non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations. where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an. atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other. memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part. of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory. operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly. equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a. Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release. store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a. Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some. complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details. Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the. target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and. therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be. impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:.

have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions. ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides. various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the. ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as. non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations. where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an. atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other. memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part. of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory. operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly. equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a. Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release. store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a. Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some. complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details. Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the. target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and. therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be. impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:. Atomic orderings. ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,. there are six levels of atomicity.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)

to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)

[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.
