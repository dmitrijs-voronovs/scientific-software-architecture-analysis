## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan'. According to the available tactics provided in the original prompt, this scenario involves a code change not being reflected in the Docker version. The relevant tactics are those under 'Reduce Coupling' and 'Defer Binding', specifically focusing on binding values at runtime or configuration time. However, upon closer inspection of the source text, it describes an issue where the Docker image was not updated to reflect the code change for printing the version. This does not directly align with any tactic listed in the prompt as the tactics are about refactoring and reducing coupling, while this is a deployment/operational issue. The AI's response field states that the system is being reported about an outdated Docker image, but it fails to correctly identify which tactic applies if any.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

",partially correct,"The AI's output claims the tactic is 'Abstract Data Sources', but this does not align with the source text which describes adding mappings and an intermediate class. The source text discusses data type conversions (double -> Real32Quant, double -> Real16) and method additions (SetHalfPrecision(), SetTruncated(), SetQuantized()), rather than abstracting or substituting test data sources. Therefore, while there might be some surface-level connection to interfaces, the primary focus is on functionality expansion, not abstraction for testing purposes."

",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the tactic as 'nan', which indicates no applicable tactics were identified. However, upon analyzing the source text and prompt rules, several relevant tactics from the Control and Observe System State category could apply: 1) Specialized Interfaces - if simulation implies a test-specific interface for REX prefix; 2) Record/Playback - if states during REX simulation are captured; 3) Localize State Storage - if the system's state related to REX is stored in one place. The text mentions 'simulate' and 'simplicity', suggesting an effort to simplify, which aligns with tactics like Limit Complexity or Control and Observe System State. Additionally, Executable Assertions could be relevant if this simulation helps detect faults. Since the AI failed to identify any applicable tactic (including incorrectly marking it as 'nan'), but there are clear connections in the source text that warrant classification under one of these tactics, the primary decision is flawed. Therefore, according to evaluation criteria, the output must be classified as incorrect."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'Runtime Registration'. According to the source text, the feature allows toggling the display of prefix stacks at runtime (via `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)`), but it is not solely about registration. The filtering mechanism uses `AddFilter` and `ClearFilter`, which are static methods for adding or removing filters, not necessarily 'registration'. Additionally, while there is a run-time option (`ShowPrefixStack` method takes a bool argument at runtime to toggle the display of prefix stacks), the primary binding described in the source text involves compile-time parameterization (the commit link) and runtime registration/lookup might be partially applicable but not exclusively. The tactic 'Runtime Registration' typically refers to explicitly registering components or services, which isn't clearly demonstrated here as it's more about a toggle method for display options rather than general service binding through registration. Moreover, the source text mentions that filtering is done at runtime (via `AddFilter` and `ClearFilter`) but without specifying if these are forms of 'registration'. The available tactics include 'Runtime Registration' which involves binding values dynamically, but in this case, it's more about toggling a feature than general registration. Therefore, the classification does not align with any specific tactic from the list accurately."

""enience build target to allow building just the. distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations. ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single. distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,. which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and. another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting. the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names. (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. Development""), and. then setting the *LLVM_&lt;distribution&gt;_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* variable to the. list of targets for that distribution. For each distribution, the build system. generates an ``install-${distribution}-distribution`` target, where. ``${distribution}`` is the name of the distribution in lowercase, to install. that distribution. Each distribution creates its own set of CMake exports, and the target to. install the CMake exports for a particular distribution for a project is named. ``${project}-${distribution}-cmake-exports``, where ``${project}`` is the name. of the project in lowercase and ``${distribution}`` is the name of the. distribution in lowercase, unless the project is LLVM, in which case the target. is just named ``${distribution}-cmake-exports``. These targets need to be. explicitly included in the *LLVM_&lt;distribution&gt;_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. variable in order to be included as part of the distribution. Unlike with the single distribution setup, when building multiple distributions,. any components specified in *LLVM_RUNTIME_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* are not. automatically added to any distribution. Instead, you must include the targets. explicitly in some *LLVM_&lt;distribution&gt;_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* list. By default, each target can appear in multiple distributions; a targ""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```. ProxyPass /root.app/ fcgi://localhost:9000/ enablereuse=on. ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html). After restarting apache server one should be able to open address: `http://apache_host_name/root.app/`. There are many ways to configure user authentication in Apache. Example of digest auth for FastCGI server:. ```. &lt;Location /root.app/""&gt;. AuthType Digest. AuthName root"". AuthDigestDomain /root.app/ root"". AuthDigestProvider file. AuthUserFile /srv/auth/auth.txt"". Require valid-user. &lt;/Location&gt;. ```. Configure fastcgi with lighttpd. An example of configuration file for **lighttpd** server is:. ```. server.modules += ( mod_fastcgi ). fastcgi.server = (. /root.app =&gt;. (( host =&gt; 192.168.1.11"",. port =&gt; 9000,. check-local =&gt; disable"",. docroot =&gt; /"". )). ). ```. Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( /root.app =&gt; (. method =&gt; digest"",. realm =&gt; root"",. require =&gt; valid-user"". ) ).

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

The response field states that the system is being instructed on various tactics, but it does not specify any particular tactic from the available list. According to the evaluation criteria, if the main decision or classification is wrong, the entire output should be marked as incorrect. In this case, the AI failed to identify and classify any of the specified tactics correctly in the response. The source text contains instructions on configuring FastCGI with Apache2 (which involves enabling modules) and Lighttpd (which involves specifying host details), but these do not directly align with any tactic from the provided list. For instance, 'Configure fastcgi with Apache' does not match any of the tactics like Monitor, Sanity Checking, Condition Monitoring, etc., as it is primarily a configuration step without fault detection or prevention elements. Similarly, authentication methods mentioned are part of 'Authorize Actors', but the AI did not explicitly classify this in its response.

- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.

If you think another approach would be better, please provide a different solution that doesn't require us to enumerate all private std modules. I just proposed one -- take the old version of the modulemap and use the virtual file system overlay to mount it on top. EDIT: As I mentioned, what Apple is using _standard_ C++ modules for is completely different from what we used them for in our dictionaries.

",incorrect,"The AI output is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify and apply any of the available tactics from the prompt. The source text discusses performance scaling issues with a PCM per header approach, but does not mention or align with any specific tactic listed in the original prompt. For example, while there are mentions about caution due to poor scalability (which relates to Control Resource Demand), no explicit action like reducing sampling rate or limiting event response is described. The proposed alternative solution uses virtual file system overlay and old modulemap versions, which does not directly correspond to any of the tactics provided in the prompt.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

The source text contains the word 'interoperability' which is not present in any of the available tactics provided in the prompt. However, the AI has classified the tactic as 'nan', indicating no applicable tactic was found. This aligns with the absence of a matching tactic but does not follow the rules precisely because it should have identified that there are no relevant tactics and thus set to 'nan'. The reasoning for the response is also flawed; it states that the system is being informed about an update, which might be true, but this does not relate to any specific tactic from the available list. Moreover, the prompt requires classifying each sentence according to one of the specified tactics or none (as per nan), and then providing a response for each classification. The AI's output only provides one field 'tactic' with value 'nan', which is incomplete because it should have multiple entries if there are multiple sentences, but here there is only one tactic field provided despite two sentences in the source text. Also, the response does not specify what action was taken or any other details required by the prompt."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

The source text indicates support for system initiative by maintaining task models (determining context) as it refers to updating patches due to changes in functionality and performance considerations, which aligns with 'Maintain task models' tactic.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly classify the tactic based on the provided rules. The source text describes a backport of changes from commit 15382 into RenderCore specifically for fixing BoxSet rendering issues on OSX in version v6-32-00-patches. This action involves preparing and repairing by implementing active redundancy principles, as all nodes would receive identical inputs (the codebase) but the output is being adjusted to fix a specific issue across different environments or versions. The tactic 'Active Redundancy' from the Recover from Faults category directly applies here because it maintains redundant spares in synchronous state, and this backport ensures that multiple systems can benefit from the same fix without disrupting active operations.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly classify or analyze the provided text according to the rules. The tactic field should not be 'nan' as there are relevant tactics that apply, such as Resource Monitoring (Metering) and Service Adaptation (Service Adaptation). However, the response field contains a flawed analysis: while it correctly identifies the issue with timeouts related to genetic optimisers, it incorrectly states that changing default methods resolves the problem. The text indicates disabling FDA_GA and enabling FDA_MT, but does not explicitly state this solves the timeout issue. Moreover, the primary classification should consider tactics from Resource Monitoring or Service Adaptation rather than just stating a response without proper tactic assignment."

    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the tactic as 'nan', which does not correspond to any available tactic in the prompt. The response mentions improving system performance, but according to the rules provided, the tactics are categorized into specific areas: Detect Faults, Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair, Prevent Faults, Resist Attacks, Control and Observe System State. None of these categories directly address performance improvement or optimization for efficiency. The source text discusses a change that reduces time taken to read CSV files by avoiding expensive stringstream construction, which is an example of optimizing system behavior for better performance. However, the prompt does not have any tactics related to performance optimization under its defined categories. Therefore, classifying this as 'nan' (no applicable tactic) might be technically correct if no matching tactic exists, but I must evaluate based on whether it follows instructions precisely. The original prompt requires analyzing available tactics and providing a JSON output with the tactic field indicating which tactic applies or none if not relevant. In this case, while performance improvement is implied, there isn't an exact match in the provided tactics list. Let's review each category: - Detect Faults: This involves monitoring system health to detect faults, but the text doesn't describe a fault being detected, it describes a change made for efficiency. - Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: These involve handling failures by reassigning or degrading, not directly about performance optimization. - Prevent Faults: About removing components that might cause failure, again not matching this scenario which is about avoiding an expensive operation to improve speed. - Resist Attacks: Focuses on security aspects like authorization and limiting access, unrelated here. - Control and Observe System State: Includes tactics like Executable Assertions or Sandbox, but the text doesn't involve testing system state or isolation for repair purposes. The change described ('Avoid expensive stringstream construction') is a performance optimization rather than fault handling or attack resistance. Since none of the defined tactics cover this aspect explicitly, classifying it as 'nan' could be acceptable if we interpret that no tactic from the list applies directly to performance improvement without causing faults. However, note that the prompt says: ""Based on the rules provided"", meaning I should use only the available tactics listed and classify accordingly. The source text does not mention any fault being detected or handled; it simply states a change for efficiency. Therefore, if we strictly adhere to the tactic definitions, this output is incorrect because 'nan' implies no applicable tactic was found, but there might be an indirect application under one of the categories? Let's see: - The category 'Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair' includes Active Redundancy (which maintains state) and Degradation. While performance improvement isn't directly stated as recovery from a fault, it could be argued that by avoiding expensive operations, we are preventing potential faults related to resource exhaustion or slow response times in high-throughput scenarios. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention any failure being recovered from; it just states an optimization made for better performance. Similarly, 'Prevent Faults' might involve anticipating and preventing issues before they occur by optimizing system behavior. But again, not directly stated. The prompt requires me to analyze the tactics based on the provided rules. I must determine if one of these tactics applies to the given text. Since the text is about improving performance (likely to prevent potential faults due to inefficiency), it could fall under 'Prevent Faults' or perhaps even 'Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair' by optimizing for better fault tolerance, but that's a stretch. The safest approach according to the prompt would be to check if any tactic is relevant: - Detect Faults: No mention of monitoring health. - Recover from Faults: No reassignment or degradation mentioned. - Prevent Faults: The change avoids an expensive operation which might prevent future performance-related issues, but it's not explicitly about fault prevention in terms of system failure avoidance. - Resist Attacks: Unrelated to security. - Control and Observe System State: Not directly related unless we consider that the change is part of observing or controlling state for testing purposes, but the text doesn't specify any test context. The original prompt says: ""analyze the following available tactics"" meaning I should map the content to one of these tactics if applicable. In this case, since no tactic seems to perfectly match (the categories are about fault detection and recovery, not performance optimization), classifying it as 'nan' might be correct under strict interpretation. However, note that the evaluation criteria requires me to judge based on whether the AI's output is a correct application of the rules. The rule in the prompt for classification: I must provide a JSON with tactic field indicating which tactic applies or none if not relevant. In this scenario, while performance improvement isn't directly covered by any tactic category, it could be argued that avoiding expensive operations prevents potential faults (e.g., system slowdowns leading to timeouts or other issues). Therefore, 'Prevent Faults' might loosely apply, but the text doesn't explicitly state fault prevention; it states a change for efficiency. The response field in the AI output is irrelevant because it's just explaining what was done without applying any tactic reasoning. Since the tactic field is set to 'nan', and no other fields are present (as per the prompt structure), this might be acceptable if we consider that none of the tactics directly apply. But let's check: The available tactics include 'Degradation' which allows dropping less critical functions, but here they improved performance by avoiding an expensive operation – not degrading anything. Also, 'Reconfiguration' involves reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources, again not matching this simple optimization change. Therefore, I think the AI's output is incorrect because it doesn't map any of the tactics from the list appropriately. However, wait: The prompt says ""Based on the rules provided"", and one rule might be that if a tactic applies, we should indicate which one; otherwise, 'nan'. But in this case, since performance improvement isn't listed as a tactic category, it's not applicable to any of them? Let me re-read the tactics. - Detect Faults: This is about monitoring system health for faults (e.g., processor failures). The text doesn't mention that. - Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: Includes Active Redundancy (maintaining state) and Degradation (dropping less critical functions). Again, not matching the performance improvement aspect without a fault occurring. - Prevent Fault"

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

""Switch t-SNE in scanpy to openTSNE; I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. Some of these recommendations (learning rate, initialization) are now default in openTSNE. There are some open issues at scanpy related to t-SNE such as https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/1150 and https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/996 but I think this suggestion would supersede them. We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102. I can see four somewhat separate suggestions:. 1. switch scanpy to using openTSNE for tSNE, using already constructed kNN graph. 2. add tSNE support for `ingest` using openTSNE functionality. 3. change default tSNE parameters (n_iter, learning rate, initialization) following openTSNE defaults. 4. add some tSNE recipes based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. What of this, if any, makes sense from the scanpy point of view?""

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly classify the provided text according to the available tactics in the original prompt. The tactic field should not be 'nan' as there are multiple relevant tactics present.

First, the suggestion to switch t-SNE implementation falls under 'Change Default Settings' (tactic 9) from the resist attacks category because it proposes altering a default behavior of Scanpy by using openTSNE instead.

Second, the idea of using pre-built kNN graphs and running downstream analysis with t-SNE can be linked to tactics related to data integrity or message integrity if we consider that building a kNN graph might involve verifying data patterns. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text.

Third, improving default parameters (learning rate, initialization) aligns with 'Change Default Settings' as it directly addresses modifying system defaults for better security against attacks like poor parameter choices leading to vulnerabilities or suboptimal results that could be exploited.

Fourth, adding t-SNE recipes based on a scientific paper might relate to maintaining audit trails if the recipe helps in tracking data processing steps. However, this is speculative and not clearly supported by the text.

The AI's response does not map these points correctly to any tactic from the provided list. It only mentions 'nan' which means no applicable tactic was identified, but upon analysis, multiple tactics are relevant: Change Default Settings for both switching implementation and adjusting parameters. The reasoning in the output is flawed because it doesn't specify which tactic applies or provide justification based on the text.

Therefore, the main decision (classification) is wrong as the AI failed to identify any applicable tactics despite clear suggestions that match existing ones."

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.

",incorrect,"The AI's output claims that the tactic field should be 'nan', but according to the original prompt, I must analyze and apply the provided tactics. The source text describes a fix for unwind info relocation on AArch64 with large code model, which is relevant to several tactics from the list. Specifically, it involves reducing size or memory usage (implicitly by handling relocations properly), increasing cohesion by ensuring correct behavior in ExecutionEngine, and possibly encapsulating specific functionalities. However, 'nan' does not correspond to any of these available tactics; it's likely a placeholder for no applicable tactic but doesn't align with the analysis required. The response field is also flawed as it states that the system is being asked to fix an issue, which might be partially true based on my understanding from the source text and prompt rules, but I need to map this to one of the specified tactics accurately."

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify the applicable tactics from the source text. The tactic field should not be 'nan' but must select one or more relevant tactics based on the rules provided in the original prompt.

First, analyze the goal: According to the original prompt, I need to detect faults, recover from faults (preparation and repair), prevent faults, resist attacks, or control and observe system state by analyzing the text. The available tactics include 'Condition Monitoring', which involves checking conditions to prevent faulty behavior; 'Reconfiguration' for recovering from failures; etc.

Now, analyze the source: The provided source_text is a sentence describing a method related to memory management in JIT compilation, specifically about remapping section addresses and compatibility with ORC JIT stacks. It also mentions that this method should be preferred over another when clients don't need access to an ExecutionEngine instance.

Scrutinize the AI's output: The tactic field is 'nan', which means no tactic was selected or it's not applicable. However, according to the rules in the original prompt, I must choose from the available tactics and provide a JSON with at least one tactic identified if relevant. In this case, the text discusses system conditions (like object loading) and how they are handled by memory managers, which aligns with fault detection or recovery mechanisms.

Specifically, the text mentions 'Memory managers' preparing code for execution in an external address space', indicating a condition monitoring aspect to prevent faults during system operation. Also, it talks about preferring this method over another when certain conditions (lack of need for ExecutionEngine) exist, which could relate to degradation or reconfiguration by adjusting based on component needs.

Therefore, the AI's output is incorrect because it did not select any tactic from the available list and provided a flawed response. The reasoning should have identified at least one relevant tactic but instead has 'nan' in the tactic field."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the tactic as 'nan'. According to the available tactics in the original prompt, there is no tactic named 'nan'. The correct approach would be to identify which tactic applies. In this case, the text discusses a behavior where operations that produce Inf result in NaN instead, and all NaNs are quiet. This relates to fault detection (Condition Monitoring or Exception Detection) as it involves monitoring system state for abnormal conditions like absence of infinity representation. However, the output does not correctly apply any tactic from the list; it fails to map the described behavior to an appropriate tactic such as 'Exception Detection' or 'Condition Monitoring'. Additionally, while the response attempts to summarize the text, it is vague and does not specify which aspect of the system state control or fault detection was applied. The output should have included a field for the detected tactic (e.g., Condition Monitoring) with reasoning based on the source text."

## Text To Analyze:
""The CudaToolChain only supports sanitizers in the sense that it allows sanitizer arguments on the command line if they are supported by the host toolchain. The CudaToolChain will actually ignore any command line arguments for any of these supported sanitizers. That means that no sanitization of device code is actually supported at this time. This behavior is necessary because the host and device toolchains invocations often share the command line, so the device toolchain must tolerate flags meant only for the host toolchain.""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

According to the original prompt, we must map these findings to one of the available tactics. For the first part ('looks good'), this could relate to tactics like Monitor or Self-Test which involve checking system health. However, the AI output has 'nan' for tactic, meaning no tactic was selected, but there is clear evidence in the text that a fault detection mechanism (like monitoring) might be implied.

For the second part ('probably nothing to do with this PR'), this suggests an exception handling or ignore faulty behavior approach. The available tactics include Exception Handling and Ignore Faulty Behavior which are relevant here.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the action as 'Removal from Service'. According to the source text, the deprecated component 'RooList' is being removed entirely. However, looking at the available tactics in the prompt, 'Removal from Service' specifically refers to temporarily placing a system component out of service (tactic 3). In contrast, the action described involves permanent removal and replacement of the component. The correct tactic should be one that aligns with preventing faults by eliminating reliance on deprecated elements, which is more closely related to tactics like 'Reconfiguration' or perhaps not directly listed but conceptually similar. However, upon closer inspection, none of the provided tactics explicitly match this action except for the fault prevention aspect. But note: The prompt's available tactics include 'Prevent Faults', and under that there is only 'Removal from Service'. This tactic implies a temporary removal to prevent faults, not permanent. In the source text, the component is permanently removed (now removed) and replaced in two cases with alternatives. Therefore, this does not fit the definition of 'Removal from Service' which suggests a temporary measure. Moreover, the prompt's rules require that we map the content to one or more tactics based on fault handling principles. The action described here involves both removal and replacement, but it is permanent (now removed). Hence, the classification as 'Removal from Service' is incorrect because it implies a temporary service withdrawal whereas in this case it is complete elimination without any mention of reassigning resources elsewhere."

If you do not specify include and library. directories explicitly, the configuration process will try the. `PYTHONDIR` environment variable or, alternatively, the standard. locations. A recent distribution of Python is required: version 2.4.3 is preferred,. but the older 2.2.x and 2.3.x versions suffice and are supported as. well. Versions older than 2.2 are not supported and will not work. Note. that one problem with 2.2 is that the shared library of the `Python`. interpreter core is not build by default and the --enable-shared flag. should thus be used when building `Python` from source. If the `Python`. interpreter that is installed on your system is too old, please obtain a. new version from &lt;http://www.python.org&gt;. Once configured, you continue the build process the normal way:. `$ make`. `$ make install`. After some time, a library called `libPyROOT.so` (or `libPyROOT.dll`, on. Windows) will be created in the. `$ROOTSYS/lib `(`$ROOTSYS/bin on Windows`) directory and a top Python. module, `ROOT.py`, will be copied into the same place. The final step is. to setup the shell environment, which is similar to what is described in. the chapter ‘Environment Settings'. Note that the `$ROOTSYS` entries are. probably already there if you followed the standard instructions, and. that the `PYTHONDIR` entries should be replaced as appropriate by your. choice at configuration time, or be left out if you had the. configuration script pick up them up from a default location.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

315,energy efficiency,"y used in `Makefiles`. Using `root-config` instead of enumerating the libraries by hand. allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT. library names change you will not need to change your Makefile. A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates,. fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core. libraries (`libCore`, `libRIO`), `libHist` and `libTree`. If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically. For example, if the **`TreeViewer`** is used, `libTreePlayer` and all. libraries `libTreePlayer` depends on are loaded also. The dependent. libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide's library dependency. graph. The difference between reference guide `libHist` and. `libHistPainter` is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and. the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it,. by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager. In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of. the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or. equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one. wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly. linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and. fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call. to fit the histogram, the fitter will dynamically load libMinuit if. it is not yet loaded.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

The original prompt requires evaluating specific tactics against the source text, but the AI only provides a single tactic field with 'nan' and a generic response that does not demonstrate understanding of any particular tactic from the list. First, the available tactics include concepts like reducing module size, increasing cohesion, reducing coupling, and deferring binding. The source text discusses building fuzzers for structured testing, which relates to some of these principles but doesn't directly apply them as per the prompt's instructions. For instance, 'Reduce Size of a Module' would involve splitting modules or refactoring, but there is no mention in the text about module size reduction. Similarly, tactics like 'Increase Cohesion', 'Reduce Coupling', and others are not addressed by the AI despite being available options. The response field contains an overly broad summary that doesn't align with any specific tactic evaluation. Therefore, since the main decision or classification (the tactic analysis) is flawed and incomplete, this output should be classified as incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

## Text To Analyze:
""&gt; I'd like the following sequence of commands ... to produce a reasonable t-SNE result that could be called t-SNE in publications. . &gt; I am worried that it may be a bit weird to refer to this as t-SNE in publications. I share the same worry, but am not qualified to answer when something becomes t-SNE"". I think it would be sufficient for `sc.tl.tsne` to warn users if the graph it was passed looks unexpected (or if it could tell it was generated by a different method). &gt; What you suggest (t-SNE on normalized UMAP affinities) could maybe achieve that. From an API point of view, we don't control weights at the `sc.tl.umap` call, so I think it would be strange to control weights at the `sc.tl.tsne` call. I'm also not sure if binarizing the graph would be closer to t-SNE"". ----------------------. About `sc.pp.neighbors` vs `sc.pp.neighbors_tsne`. &gt; This is just a question of API, and is less important for me personally. I agree that it could be better to have neighbors() compute kNN adjacency matrix without computing any weights, but this is refactoring beyond the scope of this PR. I think for backwards compatibility I would like to keep neighbors pretty much as is. I think new functions like `distance_neighbors`, `umap_neighbors`, `tsne_neighbors` could be reasonable to add. It's also possible we could add a `""tsne""` method to `neighbors`, but I think the implementation can look very similar to having a `tsne_neighbors` function, so this can be kicked down the road a bit.""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults

The original prompt requires identifying applicable tactics from 'Locate' and 'Manage Interfaces'.

But the AI's output does not provide any classification of these actions under the given tactics.

Moreover, the response field is vague and doesn't demonstrate understanding of the tactics or how they relate to the source text. It simply restates part of the input without connecting it to the evaluation criteria.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

The tactic field is set to 'nan', which is not a valid tactic from the available list and indicates an error or lack of classification. Additionally, the response field provides a generic description that does not align with any specific tactic mentioned in the prompt. The original prompt requires analyzing the tactics provided (e.g., Detect Faults, Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair, etc.) against the source text to identify which tactics are relevant. However, the AI's output fails to classify the system according to one of these tactical categories. For instance, the source text discusses ownership management for transformations and caching mechanisms, but none of these directly correspond to the available tactics without further analysis. The tactic 'nan' suggests no applicable tactic was found or an error occurred in classification, which is not supported by the prompt's instructions as it requires selecting from predefined categories. Moreover, the response does not provide a reasoned application based on any tactic; instead, it offers a vague summary that doesn't meet the criteria for being grounded in tactical analysis."

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because the main decision or classification fails to identify a relevant tactic from the provided list. The source text discusses memory management and reference counting, which relates to tactics like 'Maintain task models' (involving system assistance) or potentially 'Cancel', 'Undo', etc., but more directly, it aligns with 'Support System Initiative: Maintain task models'. However, the AI's response only states that no tactic is described, whereas upon closer inspection of the source text, it does contain elements about maintaining correctness in memory management (which could be seen as part of system assistance). Additionally, the output field <tactic> has a value 'nan', which doesn't correspond to any available tactic and lacks justification from the source text. The reasoning provided by the AI is flawed because it overlooks that the text's focus on reference counting models might relate to maintaining task or system models for error prevention."

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

",incorrect,"The AI's output indicates that it did not correctly identify any tactics from the available list. However, upon analyzing the source text, I can see several elements that align with software configuration or build system settings. The text contains paths for includes and libraries (e.g., /build/lcgsoft/releases/dev4cuda/Vc/1.4.1/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include) which suggests a setup process, possibly related to building the TMVA module with specific dependencies. This configuration appears to be binding values at build time or compile time through explicit paths and libraries listed in the source text. The available tactics include 'Reduce Size of a Module', 'Increase Cohesion', 'Reduce Coupling', and 'Defer Binding'. None of these categories directly match the observed actions, but there is an element that could relate to reducing coupling by encapsulating dependencies or increasing cohesion by organizing modules properly. However, the AI's response does not specify any tactic from the list; it only states a general observation about system configuration without applying any rule-based analysis. The output field 'tactic' remains as 'nan', which is incorrect because no tactics were considered or applied in the evaluation process. Therefore, the main decision (classification) is flawed and the entire output should be marked as incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Resource Monitoring
- **Metering**: Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.

3816,integrability,"[ntuple] Overhaul tuning and default settings when writing; This Pull request:. The PR sets new defaults for the cluster size and page size of RNTuple. The default should work well in the majority of cases but can be adjusted if needed. The idea is to give target sizes for clusters and pages (measured in bytes). RNTuple will try make good decisions and approximate the target sizes. The PR replaces previous defaults for cluster size and page size given in number of entries and number of elements resp. Changes or fixes:. The PR sets three new defaults:. - Target size for compressed clusters of 50MB. In general, larger clusters provide room for more and larger pages and should improve compression ratio and speed. However, clusters also need to be buffered during write and (partially) during read, so larger cluster increase the memory footprint. - Maximum size for uncompressed clusters of 512MiB. Prevents very compressible clusters from growing too large. That is mostly a problem for writing. - Target size for uncompressed pages of 64KiB. In general, larger pages give better compression ratios. Smaller pages, however, reduce the memory footprint. When reading, every active column requires at least one page buffer. For the number of read requests, the page size does not matter because pages of the same column are written consecutively and therefore read in one go. Given the three settings, writing works as follows: when the current cluster is larger than the maximum uncompressed size, it will be flushed unconditionally. When the current cluster size reaches the estimate for the compressed cluster size, it will be flushed, too. The estimated compression ratio for the first cluster is 0.5 if compression is used, and 1 otherwise. The following clusters use the compression ratio of the last cluster as estimate. Pages are filled until the target size and then flushed. If a column has enough elements to fill at least half a page, there is a mechanism to prevent undersized","

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan'. According to the original prompt's rules for analyzing tactics, I must identify which of the available tactics applies to the given text. The text discusses integrating a patch to enable accessing lambdas in PyROOT, which is related to modifying system functionality or addressing missing features. This falls under tactics that involve improving system capabilities, but none of the provided tactics directly match this description. Tactics like 'Change Default Settings' might be relevant if default settings were being modified, but here it's about integrating a patch for a specific feature (accessing lambdas). None of the other tactics such as 'Detect Attacks', 'Resist Attacks', or 'React to Attacks' seem applicable because the text does not describe any attack detection, resistance, reaction, or recovery. The primary conclusion that no tactic applies is correct, but the AI output incorrectly labels it with a value (nan) which implies there was an attempt to classify something but failed. However, according to evaluation criteria, if the main decision or classification is wrong, then the entire output should be 'incorrect'. In this case, the tactic field being set to 'nan' indicates that no tactic was found, which aligns with my analysis and would actually be correct. But wait, let's reexamine: The prompt requires providing a JSON output with specific fields including 'tactic', but in the available tactics list, there is no 'nan' option. Therefore, setting 'tactic' to 'nan' does not follow the instructions precisely because it should only contain one of the defined tactic names or indicate absence appropriately. However, looking at the prompt again: It says ""Based on the rules provided, analyze the following available tactics and text and provide the JSON output."" The JSON structure in the example is not specified beyond having 'tactic' and 'response'. But typically for such evaluations, we would expect to map to one of the tactic categories if applicable. Since none apply, perhaps the correct response should have an empty string or a specific indicator like null instead of 'nan', which might be considered incorrect because it doesn't match any expected value from the tactics list.

But note: The prompt does not explicitly define what values are allowed for each field except that we must use the available tactics. However, in this case, no tactic applies so perhaps leaving it as null or empty is acceptable? But wait, let's check the criteria again:

- `correct`: ALL fields present and correct.
- `partially correct`: Main decision correct but at least one part flawed.
- `incorrect`: Main decision wrong regardless of other parts.

In this output, there are two fields: 'tactic' and 'response'. The tactic field is set to 'nan', which does not correspond to any available tactic. This means the classification is incorrect because we must choose from the provided tactics or indicate absence appropriately (but note that in JSON format, perhaps an empty string would be better). However, since no tactic applies, setting it to null might be acceptable but 'nan' is a floating point value and not standard for this context.

Moreover, the response field should provide reasoning based on source text. The AI's response says: ""The system is being asked to integrate a cppyy patch..."" which seems accurate. But because the tactic classification is flawed (using an invalid label), I would classify it as partially correct or incorrect? Let me think.

According to evaluation criteria, if the main decision or classification is wrong then entire output is 'incorrect'. Here, what is the main decision? The AI's output has a field for 'tactic' which should be one of the available tactics. Since none apply, perhaps setting it to null would indicate absence correctly, but they used 'nan', which might imply an attempt at classification that failed (NaN meaning Not a Number). However, in this context, we are classifying among discrete categories, so using NaN is inappropriate.

Furthermore, note the source text: It describes integrating a patch for lambdas. This could be seen as part of improving system functionality or addressing missing features. But none of the tactics directly address that except perhaps 'Change Default Settings' if it were about changing defaults to enable this feature. However, the text does not mention default settings being changed; it's about integrating an external patch.

Therefore, I conclude: The tactic field should be empty (or null) because no applicable tactic exists from the list provided. But since 'nan' is used and that doesn't match any available tactic category, this output is incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

",incorrect,"The AI's output claims the tactic is 'nan', which likely indicates no applicable tactic was found. However, upon analyzing the source text, it describes a system component that appears to be performing an operation similar to splitting or transforming data (using Builder to create a unary operator). This could relate to tactics like 'Condition Monitoring' if there were checks involved, but the description does not explicitly mention fault detection or recovery mechanisms.

The original prompt requires identifying which tactic from the list applies to the given text. The source text describes an operation that might be part of system design or implementation without mentioning faults directly. Tactics such as 'Ping/Echo', 'Monitor', etc., are about fault handling, but this text is more about defining a component's behavior rather than detecting or recovering from faults.

Therefore, the AI incorrectly classified the tactic as 'nan' (no applicable) because there might be an overlap with tactics like 'Condition Monitoring' if we interpret Builder and Name in terms of system checks. However, even then, the text does not explicitly discuss fault handling; it's describing a normal operational mechanism for creating unary operators. The AI should have considered that this description is about building or defining something (possibly related to preventing faults by expanding competence set) but did not identify any applicable tactic correctly."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

However, the provided <ai_output_to_verify> only contains a tactic field with value 'nan', which indicates no applicable tactic was identified. This contradicts the evaluation task because I must determine if the output is correct based on applying the prompt's rules to the source text.

The original prompt states: ""Based on the rules provided, analyze the following available tactics and text..."" The available tactics are 'Locate', 'Manage Interfaces' (with sub-tactic 'Orchestrate'), and 'Tailor Interface'. I must check if these tactics were correctly applied to the source text.

In the <ai_output_to_verify>, there is no field for 'response' that classifies or analyzes any of the available tactics. The response field should have analyzed how each tactic applies, but it does not mention them at all. Instead, it gives a generic description without tying it back to specific tactics from the prompt.

Moreover, the tactic field only has one value: 'nan'. According to the rules in the original prompt, I need to identify which of the available tactics is relevant for each part of the text or overall analysis. The source text discusses IDE configuration issues related to build systems and compile options knowledge, but it does not explicitly mention any of the three tactics provided.

The AI's output fails to meet the criteria because:
1. It did not identify any tactic from the available list (only 'nan' is present).
2. The response field does not analyze or classify based on the tactics; it provides a generic summary without reference to the prompt's rules.
3. There are no fields for analyzing other aspects like 'Manage Interfaces' or 'Tailor Interface'.

Therefore, since the main decision (classification) is flawed and incomplete, this output should be classified as incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

Analyze the source: The source text discusses methods in ObjC programming related to interfaces and declarations, but it doesn't explicitly mention services or orchestration as per the available tactics.

Scrutinize the output: The AI's response has a tactic field with 'nan', which is not one of the provided tactics.

The text discusses changes in column reader types for handling different data sources. This could potentially relate to one or more of the provided tactics:

",incorrect,"The AI's output does not correctly apply the rules from the original prompt. The task was to analyze the text based on available tactics and provide JSON with tactic and response fields. However, the provided ai_output_to_verify has a tactic field set to 'nan', which is incorrect as it should be one of the specified tactics or properly classified. Additionally, the response field contains an analysis that does not align with any of the given tactics (Locate, Manage Interfaces, Orchestrate, Tailor Interface). The text discusses generating dictionaries in a subdirectory and build directory structure, but none of these actions directly match the available tactics provided in the prompt. For instance, 'ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY' is mentioned, which might relate to managing interfaces by tailoring or orchestrating, but without proper classification according to the rules, it's flawed.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.
