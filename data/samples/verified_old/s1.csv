### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies a sentence about C preprocessor behavior as relating to the quality attribute 'security'. The original prompt requires analysis for the specific quality attribute of security, which involves protection against malicious actors and explicit mention of security threats or mechanisms. However, the provided source text discusses preprocessing in C code (handling identifiers, include guards) without any reference to security aspects such as unauthorized access, injection attacks, or data confidentiality/availability. The AI's reasoning attempts to link this functionality description with a non-functional goal ('maintaining system integrity'), but it fails to connect this to the required 'security' attribute.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

**4. Content to Analyze:** tion,. $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,. the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives. information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often. called by physicists the *parameter errors*.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classified a sentence about calculating parameter errors as an example of 'availability' in the software context. According to the original prompt, availability refers to masking or repairing faults for system-level uptime and recovery from major failures (Step 3).

Therefore, this is a false positive as it does not align with the scope of availability defined in the prompt."

The source text does not explicitly discuss energy efficiency, but rather a potential issue with software reproduction. However, upon closer inspection, the prompt requires to check if the sentence is an example of the specific quality attribute (energy efficiency). The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that even though the primary intent might be about functionality or problem verification, it could still contain implicit references to energy efficiency if framed appropriately. In this case, the sentence does not mention anything related to reducing power consumption, optimizing for battery life, or lowering resource usage for environmental reasons. It is solely focused on debugging and verifying a software issue, which falls under reliability or maintainability attributes rather than energy efficiency. Therefore, according to Step 2 of the prompt, it should be classified as 'false' because it does not describe why the code was designed with respect to non-functional goals like energy efficiency.

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** A utility class used to compute instruction encodings for a code region. It provides a simple API to compute and return instruction encodings as strings. Encodings are cached internally for later usage.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

    <reasoning>The content describes functionality by mentioning what the utility class does: computing instruction encodings. However, to be a direct example of testability, it should explicitly explain why this design choice enhances testing capabilities (e.g., caching for faster unit tests).

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content is from a software context and differentiates between describing functionality and quality attributes. However, it incorrectly classifies the example as a true positive for testability because the source text does not explicitly state why the design choice enhances testing capabilities. The description only mentions what the utility class does (computing instruction encodings) without providing any reasoning related to non-functional goals like making testing easier. Therefore, according to Step 2 and Step 3 of the original prompt, this is a false positive for testability as it lacks direct evidence explaining the 'why'."

This shouldn't prevent us from including the builtin header textually in this module.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly analyze the content according to the rules in the original prompt. The source text appears to be an internal comment from a software codebase, discussing builtin headers and their usage across modules, which fits within Step 1 as being plausibly from a software context. However, the AI incorrectly classifies this as out of scope for Step 1 by stating it reads like an internal comment but does not explicitly describe deployability.

In Step 2, the primary intent should be analyzed: The content describes why builtin headers are handled in a certain way (to allow multiple modules to use them without conflict), which is a non-functional design consideration related to code structure and maintenance. This aligns with 'Describing a Quality Attribute' as it explains the rationale behind handling builtin headers differently from modular ones.

In Step 3, we must check if this intent falls within the scope for deployability: The prompt specifically states that deployability relates to infrastructure, automation, and processes for release/installation. However, the content does not mention anything about deployment tools or processes; it discusses code design aspects (handling builtin headers) which is more related to modifiability/maintainability.

Therefore, based on Step 3, this should be classified as a false positive because the intent falls outside the defined scope for deployability. The AI's reasoning in Step 2 was flawed by not clearly differentiating between functionality and quality attributes; it correctly identified that the content is about why code is designed but failed to recognize that the specific reason (handling builtin headers) does not relate to deployment infrastructure.

In Step 4, we must apply strict guardrails: The prompt requires direct evidence for deployability. Since this example describes a design choice related to modifiability rather than deployability, it should be classified as false positive."

Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to decide how much data to accumualte before producing output, in order to maximize compression.

Flushing may degrade compression for some compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary. If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is desired.

If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the evaluation result as `false_positive` but in this case, it should be classified as `true_positive`. The content to analyze is a comment from software codebase (likely C++), which falls within the scope of Step 1. It describes functionality related to error handling and recovery mechanisms for MSVC compatibility mode. However, upon closer inspection, the mention of 'MSVC compatibility mode' implies an interaction with another system or environment (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler). The phrase 'Give Sema a chance to recover' suggests that there is an attempt to handle errors in a way that might be necessary when interfacing with external systems like MSVC. This can be interpreted as ensuring the codebase works across different environments, which relates to interoperability. Therefore, despite being primarily about error handling, it does touch upon interoperability by addressing compatibility issues with another system (MSVC). The AI's reasoning is flawed because it fails to recognize that the context of 'MSVC compatibility mode' directly implies an external system interaction, thus meeting the criteria for interoperability in Step 3. Moreover, the rule from Step 1 allows software comments as long as they are not out-of-scope (like scientific abstracts), and this content is clearly a software comment.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

However, upon closer inspection, the prompt's Scope & Distinctions explicitly require examples involving separate systems and standardized data formats or network protocols. The provided content is about internal code mechanisms (frame pointers, EHRegNodeFrameIndex) which are not related to external systems or interoperability standards. Therefore, while there might be a tangential connection if we stretch the definition, it does not meet the strict criteria for interoperability as defined in the prompt. Moreover, the AI's reasoning states that the content describes functionality and not quality attributes, but this is too broad; the prompt requires specific differentiation between describing interoperability (a non-functional goal) versus other functional aspects.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** security

**2. Attribute Description:** Security is the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorised access or manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for legitimate users.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on protection against malicious actors. Strong examples will explicitly mention a security threat (e.g., injection attack, unauthorized access) or a security mechanism (e.g., encryption, input sanitization, authentication).

**4. Content to Analyze:** Thanks, @reikdas ! Did you take these from somewhere or did you create them from scratch? If the former, please reference the original at least in the commit log.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Insert a node into the DAG at least before Pos. This will reposition the node as needed, and will assign it a node ID that is &lt;= Pos's ID. Note that this does *not* preserve the uniqueness of node IDs! The selection DAG must no longer depend on their uniqueness when this function is used.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

    </original_prompt>
    
    <ai_output_to_verify>
        <true_positive>True</true_positive>
    <reasoning>The content describes how nodes are inserted into the DAG with specific conditions regarding node IDs. This indicates a design choice that ensures components can be combined effectively by managing dependencies through ID assignment, which directly relates to integrability.</reasoning>
    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the sentence as a true positive for integrability. The original prompt requires evaluating if the content is an example of integrability, which involves assessing whether it describes a quality attribute (how) or just functionality (what). In Step 2, I must differentiate between describing functionality and describing why something was designed that way.

The sentence provided in <source_text> does not explicitly describe 'why' behind the design choice. It simply states what action is taken: inserting nodes into a DAG with conditions on node IDs. This falls under 'Describing Functionality', which according to Step 2 of the original prompt, should be classified as false positive.

Moreover, in Step 3, I must ensure that if it's describing functionality, it doesn't qualify as integrability unless there is explicit reasoning about why this design choice supports integrability. The sentence lacks such direct evidence; it only describes an operation without explaining its purpose or benefit for combining components effectively.

Therefore, the AI failed to follow Step 2 and incorrectly labeled a purely functional description as relating to integrability."

Instead, it describes what must be done regarding register usage - ensuring correct destination sub-register choice.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as a true positive for 'availability'. The original prompt requires strict adherence to the definition of availability, which focuses on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. However, the provided source text describes various functionalities (e.g., custom line styles, changing label attributes) without explicitly linking them to why these features ensure high availability or fault tolerance in a system context. These are examples of component-level customization rather than mechanisms for handling crashes or network outages as required by the scope distinctions.

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the content as a false positive for deployability when in fact, it should be evaluated based on the provided rules. The source text describes a mathematical process related to signal processing (DCT and cosine transforms), which is clearly scientific or technical documentation outside of software deployment context. However, according to Step 1 of the original prompt, if the content does not read like software codebase comment, it should be out of scope for deployability analysis. The AI correctly identified that this is a false positive because the context is scientific and not related to software deployment processes (Step 1). But wait, let's reexamine: Step 2 requires differentiating between describing functionality vs quality attribute. This sentence describes what the code does ('process rows', 'results are scaled up by sqrt(8)', etc.) so it might be a description of functionality rather than quality attribute. However, Step 3 specifically states that deployability must relate to infrastructure, automation, or processes for release/installation. The content doesn't mention any such elements - no build scripts, package managers, Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines. Therefore, the AI's evaluation is correct: it should be false positive."

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** safety

**2. Attribute Description:** Safety refers to the software's ability to avoid entering hazardous states that could cause damage, injury, or loss of life, and to recover or limit harm if such states are entered.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on preventing physical harm or catastrophic failure. Strong examples will relate to systems where a failure could cause real-world harm (e.g., medical, automotive) and describe a mechanism to prevent that specific harm.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the sentence as a true positive for security. The original prompt requires evaluating if the content is an example of the quality attribute 'security'. However, the provided source text discusses error logging modes and does not explicitly mention any security threat or mechanism related to protection against malicious actors. Instead, it describes functionality regarding how errors are handled in terms of printing or accumulating without detailing why this design choice enhances security (e.g., preventing injection attacks). The AI's reasoning incorrectly infers a connection to reliability by mentioning denial-of-service attacks, which is not supported by the source text and does not align with the prompt's strict definition of security. Therefore, the classification should be false positive as per Step 1 and Step 2."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes an intent to change the code structure for better modifiability by removing a type erasure mechanism. It explicitly states that the goal is to simplify future development and reduce complexity in handling different mergeable value types, which aligns with the quality attribute of modifiability as per the scope guardrails.","Now, perform your evaluation based on the content within the <evaluation_data> block below.

What do you think? My understanding is as follows: `RVariedAction::GetMergeableValue`'s signature is `std::unique_ptr&lt;RMergeableValueBase&gt; GetMergeableValue() const` . Inside the implementation of this function, I have no typename `T` with which I could construct internally a `std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;RDFDetail::RMergeableValue&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;`. Thus, I need a struct that holds a `std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;RDFDetail::RMergeableValueBase&gt;&gt;` (keep in mind that any subclass of `RActionImpl` defined in `ActionHelpers.hxx` has a method `std::unique_ptr&lt;RMergeableValueBase&gt; GetMergeableValue() const`, so inside `RVariedAction`'s `GetMergeableValue` I don't have any information about the concrete mergeable value type). I would also just return a `std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;RDFDetail::RMergeableValueBase&gt;&gt;` directly from this method, but then I would break the pattern of passing around unique ptrs to `RMergeableValueBase` and I would need to change the interface just for `RVariedAction`</sentence>

I think you'd be able to get an output close to what you would currently like with:. ```python. import scanpy as sc, pandas as pd, numpy as np. pbmc = sc.datasets.pbmc3k_processed().raw.to_adata(). pbmc.obs[""sampleid""] = np.repeat([""s1"", s2""], pbmc.n_obs / 2). df = sc.get.obs_df(pbmc, [""LDHB"", louvain"", sampleid""]). summarized = df.pivot_table(. index=[""louvain"", sampleid""],. values=""LDHB"",. aggfunc=[np.mean, np.count_nonzero]. ). color_df = summarized[""mean""].unstack(). size_df = summarized[""count_nonzero""].unstack().

I think this functionality could be more generic, and inspired by the `pd.pivot_table` function. This could end up looking like:. ```python.

2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**4. Content to Analyze:**  was a single variable which would be used to fill cell in the plot. As an example:. ```python. pbmc = sc.datasets.pbmc3k_processed().raw.to_adata(). pbmc.obs[""sampleid""] = np.repeat([""s1"", s2""], pbmc.n_obs / 2). sc.pl.dotplot(pbmc, var_names='LDHB', groupby=['louvain', sampleid'], groupby_expand=True). ```. ![tmpdm8256t1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238804/144899323-c439785d-5d57-4a18-b6e5-2b12412465f8.PNG). Instead of having an argument which changes the interpretation of the earlier arguments, I would prefer more orthogonal arguments. I think you'd be able to get an output close to what you would currently like with:. ```python. import scanpy as sc, pandas as pd, numpy as np. pbmc = sc.datasets.pbmc3k_processed().raw.to_adata(). pbmc.obs[""sampleid""] = np.repeat([""s1"", s2""], pbmc.n_obs / 2). df = sc.get.obs_df(pbmc, [""LDHB"", louvain"", sampleid""]). summarized = df.pivot_table(. index=[""louvain"", sampleid""],. values=""LDHB"",. aggfunc=[np.mean, np.count_nonzero]. ). color_df = summarized[""mean""].unstack(). size_df = summarized[""count_nonzero""].unstack(). I don't think the var_names or groupby variables are actually important here. sc.pl.DotPlot(. pbmc,. var_names=""LDHB"", groupby=[""louvain"", sampleid""], Just here so it doesn't error. dot_color_df=color_df, dot_size_df=size_df,. ).style(cmap=""Reds"").show(). ```. I think this functionality could be more generic, and inspired by the `pd.pivot_table` function. This could end up looking like:. ```python.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

The source text describes a logger as 'A logger that simply writes messages...', which fits clearly within a software codebase or documentation context (Step 1 passes). Then, in Step 2, I need to differentiate between describing functionality and describing quality attributes. While the sentence does describe what the logger does—writing messages—it doesn't inherently explain why this design choice was made for deployability. However, based on the prompt's rules, specifically the Principle of Direct Evidence (Rule 2), a true positive requires explicit description of *why* it relates to deployability. The AI correctly identified that there is no direct evidence but failed to recognize that Step 1 passed and thus incorrectly concluded false_positive overall. Additionally, in its reasoning, the AI does not properly reference all steps; for instance, it doesn't mention the context check first before jumping to intent analysis.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** performance

**2. Attribute Description:** Performance is a system's ability to meet its timing requirements, encompassing its time-based response to events and its efficiency in resource usage under specified conditions.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on speed, latency, throughput, and resource usage. Strong examples will explicitly mention speed (e.g., 'faster'), time (e.g., 'reduces latency'), or resource usage (e.g., 'uses less memory').

**4. Content to Analyze:** Returns the strongest permitted ordering on failure, given the desired ordering on success. If the comparison in a cmpxchg operation fails, there is no atomic store so release semantics cannot be provided. So this function drops explicit Release requests from the AtomicOrdering. A SequentiallyConsistent operation would remain SequentiallyConsistent.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Clear the current list of physical nodes, so that we can start over with a new list. If MUSTDELETE is true, delete previous nodes.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Update the size of an existing stream. This will allocate or deallocate blocks as needed to match the requested size. This can fail if `CanGrow` was set to false when initializing the `MSFBuilder`.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**4. Content to Analyze:** [cxxmodules] CLING_MODULEMAP_PATH becomes CLING_MODULEMAP_FILES; This allows users to specify the modulemap name not just the folder. The CLING_MODULEMAP_FILES env variable should have a list of space-separated files which cling will try to load as modulemaps.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

It fails Step 2 by not describing a quality attribute but rather just a feature description. Additionally, it does not align with Scope & Distinctions which demand explicit reduction of computing resource consumption for environmental reasons."

The evaluation task requires determining if a sentence is an example of interoperability, which involves exchanging information between separate systems using standardized formats or protocols. However, the provided source text does not describe any such exchange; instead, it explains how to read profile variant flags (FE and IR) for system identification within what appears to be internal documentation or comments about code generation types. The AI's reasoning incorrectly states that interoperability requires explicit explanation of why a design choice was made in terms of non-functional goals, but the source text does not even attempt such an explanation—it simply describes functionality related to reading header flags. Moreover, Step 1 mandates checking if the content is from a software context; while it appears technical and possibly from code documentation, its primary intent as per Step 2 is describing functionality (identifying system types) rather than quality attributes like interoperability. The AI failed to recognize that the sentence does not relate to exchanging information between separate systems at all, nor does it mention any standardized format or protocol for communication with external systems—instead, it's about internal categorization within a single codebase context. Therefore, according to Step 2 and Step 3 of the original prompt, this should be classified as false positive since interoperability requires evidence of interaction between separate systems, not just system identification."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

(This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at the upsample step needn't be much less than one.) To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row. (The last row group can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context, and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.) We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but that'd be very slow. We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather strange pointer structure. Here's how it works. We allocate a workspace consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number of row groups per iMCU row). We create two sets of redundant pointers to the workspace. Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized pointer lists look like this: M+1 M-1 master pointer --> 0 master pointer --> 0 1 1 ... ...

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the source text as a true positive for testability. The original prompt requires evaluating if the content is a direct example of testability, with specific focus on describing why code/design choices enhance testability through controllability and observability or simplify testing practices.

First, Step 1: Context Check - The provided source text appears to be from compiler documentation (mentioning runtime unrolling, prologue/epilogue) rather than software codebase comments. It discusses technical constraints in compilation which is not typical of inline code comments but more like a technical note or abstract about compiler behavior.

Step 2: Intent vs. Quality - The content primarily describes functionality and limitations related to compiler optimizations (what the compiler does, why it cannot use unrolling). However, according to the prompt's definition, testability must be described in terms of simplifying testing for software engineers. This text doesn't directly relate to a developer's ability to test code; instead, it talks about how compilers handle loops.

Step 3: Scope & Distinctions - The scope requires examples that mention specific testing practices (like dependency injection) or features added for testing purposes. Here, the content is about compiler restrictions and potential control-dependency issues which doesn't align with simplifying testing for developers.

Step 4: Final Decision - Since the primary intent of the source text is to explain a compiler limitation rather than why code/design choices improve testability, it fails Step 2 criteria. Therefore, this should be classified as false positive. The AI's reasoning incorrectly interprets the technical details about compiler unrolling as directly related to software testability when they are actually discussing compilation techniques."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

It merely explains how different file extensions determine output formats without addressing why these choices are made for performance goals.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the sentence as a true positive for integrability. The original prompt requires differentiation between describing functionality and quality attributes, with specific focus on APIs, component design, or dependency management for integrability. The provided sentence primarily describes how to run tests (functional aspect) without explicitly addressing why it is designed this way in terms of non-functional goals like integrability. It does not mention mechanisms that reduce coupling or allow different parts to be combined effectively; instead, it focuses on testing across platforms which relates more to reliability and portability."

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Determine the availability of the given declaration. This routine will determine the most restrictive availability of the given declaration (e.g., preferring unavailable to deprecated'). \param Message If non-NULL and the result is not \c AR_Available, will be set to a (possibly empty) message describing why the declaration has not been introduced, is deprecated, or is unavailable. \param EnclosingVersion The version to compare with. If empty, assume the deployment target version. \param RealizedPlatform If non-NULL and the availability result is found in an available attribute it will set to the platform which is written in the available attribute.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the sentence as a true positive for 'integrability'. The original prompt requires evaluating if the content is a direct and unambiguous example of integrability, which focuses on ease of combination between software components. However, the provided source text discusses declaration availability (e.g., parameters like Message, EnclosingVersion, RealizedPlatform), not integrability or its related aspects such as APIs for pluggability. The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that the sentence primarily describes functionality without explicitly addressing why it was designed for a non-functional goal of integrability. Instead, it should have focused on whether the content explains 'why' in relation to integrability, but it does not do so and incorrectly concludes true_positive: True."

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content is from a software context and classifies it as a true positive. However, the reasoning provided by the AI does not fully align with the evaluation criteria. The original prompt requires differentiation between describing functionality (what the code does) and describing a quality attribute (why it was designed to achieve non-functional goals). In this case, the source text describes changes made in the pull-request, which includes both what was done ('disable runtime resolution') and why ('to prevent misleading diagnostic messages'). The AI's output correctly points out that there is no explicit explanation of reliability improvement. But according to Step 2, if the content explains 'why', it could be a true positive for reliability. In fact, the text mentions preventing failures due to incorrect parsing leading to misleading diagnostics, which relates to reliability (as defined in Scope & Distinctions). Therefore, while the AI correctly notes that there is no explicit explanation of reliability improvement, its overall classification as true_positive might not be entirely accurate because Step 2 allows for a description of quality attribute if it explains 'why'. The source text does explain why: by preventing incorrect behavior and misleading messages. However, the prompt's rule (Principle of Direct Evidence) requires that the content explicitly describes the 'why' in relation to reliability specifically. Since the text says ""This caused clang to start parsing an expression, which ended up in misleading diagnostic messages"", it implies a problem with reliability but does not directly state that this change improves reliability under defined conditions for a given period as required by the attribute description. The AI's reasoning is partially correct because it correctly identifies the lack of explicit 'why' for reliability, but fails to recognize that the content might still be describing functionality (what was changed) rather than quality attributes."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the sentence as a true positive for integrability. The original prompt requires evaluating if the content is a direct and unambiguous example of integrability, with specific guardrails against false positives.

First, Step 1: Context Check - The provided source text appears to be from a user query or conversation (e.g., 'You can use...', 'Are you having issues...'), not from a software codebase or technical documentation. It is conversational and does not fit the typical style of software comments.

Step 2: Intent vs. Quality - The primary intent here is to describe functionality ('use the `categories_order` argument') and ask about potential issues, but it does not explicitly state *why* this design choice was made for a non-functional goal like integrability. It lacks direct evidence of quality attributes.

Step 3: Scope & Distinctions - The sentence mentions checking versions and compatibility with newer releases, which is more related to maintainability or version compatibility rather than integrability (which focuses on combining components). There's no explicit mention of APIs, component design, or dependency management that enable combination.

Step 4: Final Decision - Since the content does not meet Step 1 criteria (out of scope for software context) and fails to describe a quality attribute directly with evidence from the source text, it should be classified as false positive. The AI's reasoning incorrectly assumes the sentence is about integrability when it actually describes functionality and potential maintainability issues."

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** interoperability

**2. Attribute Description:** Interoperability is the degree to which two or more systems can usefully exchange and correctly interpret meaningful information via their interfaces within a particular context.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on data formats and protocols for exchanging information between *separate systems*. Strong examples will mention a standardized data format (like JSON, XML, TSV) or a network protocol for communication with an external system.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as a true positive for 'interoperability'. However, upon analysis of the source text and applying the rules from the original prompt, it is clear that the primary intent of the provided sentence is to describe functionality (how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO) rather than describing a quality attribute. The rule in Step 2 states that for a true positive, the content must explicitly describe the 'why' behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. In this case, the text does not explain why certain features are implemented; it simply describes what actions should be taken during the build process. Additionally, the Scope & Distinctions in Step 3 require explicit mention of standardized data formats or network protocols for exchanging information between separate systems, which is absent here. The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that describing steps without addressing non-functional goals does not qualify as a true positive for interoperability."

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies a false positive as true. The content to analyze is an instruction for returning opcodes, which describes functionality (what the code does) rather than explicitly stating why it was designed that way in terms of energy efficiency or other non-functional goals. It lacks direct evidence linking the addressing mode change to minimizing power consumption, battery life, or resource reduction for environmental reasons. The rule from Step 1 requires checking if the content is plausibly a comment from software codebase or documentation; this text reads like an instruction in coding rather than a design rationale. Additionally, Step 2 mandates differentiating between describing functionality and quality attributes: here, it only describes what operation to perform without explaining the 'why' for energy efficiency."

Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** interoperability

**2. Attribute Description:** Interoperability is the degree to which two or more systems can usefully exchange and correctly interpret meaningful information via their interfaces within a particular context.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on data formats and protocols for exchanging information between *separate systems*. Strong examples will mention a standardized data format (like JSON, XML, TSV) or a network protocol for communication with an external system.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Swift happens to implement ISHST barriers in a way that's compatible with Release semantics but weaker than ISH so we'd be fools not to use it. Beware: other processors probably don't!

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Additionally, in Step 4, the decision should be based on whether the content falls squarely within the scope for energy efficiency.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Check if Ty is a usable substitute for the coercion type.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,The content states that Ty can be used as a substitute for the coercion type. This indicates a design choice where Ty is being selected over another type to achieve better integrability by reducing coupling and providing a more flexible mechanism for handling types in the system.,"Now, perform your evaluation based on the content within the <evaluation_data> block below.

2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** modifiability

**2. Attribute Description:** Modifiability refers to the ease with which changes, such as adding, deleting, or modifying functionality, quality attributes, capacity, or technology, can be made to a system, ideally involving the fewest distinct elements.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code structure that makes future changes easier. Strong examples will mention refactoring, decoupling, modularity, or using a design pattern for the explicit purpose of simplifying future development.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** energy efficiency

**2. Attribute Description:** Energy efficiency, also known as 'green computing', describes how well software minimises its consumption of computing resources, thus reducing associated costs like electricity, weight, and physical footprint.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on minimizing the consumption of computing resources. Strong examples will explicitly mention reducing power draw, optimizing for battery life, or lowering CPU/memory usage for thermal or environmental reasons.

**4. Content to Analyze:** A GCStrategy which serves as an example for the usage of a statepoint based lowering strategy. This GCStrategy is intended to suitable as a default implementation usable with any collector which can consume the standard stackmap format generated by statepoints, uses the default addrespace to distinguish between gc managed and non-gc managed pointers, and has reasonable relocation semantics.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

    <reasoning>The content describes a GCStrategy that serves as an example for usage of a statepoint based lowering strategy. It explains what the code does: providing a default implementation usable with any collector which can consume stackmap format, using default address space to distinguish pointers, and having reasonable relocation semantics. However, it also states the intent (purpose) behind this design choice, mentioning that it is suitable as a default implementation for minimizing resource consumption in some way. This meets the principle of direct evidence by explicitly describing why such a strategy would be beneficial: reducing associated costs like electricity or physical footprint implicitly through its intended use and efficiency.</reasoning>

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the sentence as a true positive for energy efficiency. The sentence describes a GCStrategy (Garbage Collection Strategy) that is intended to be used with any collector consuming standard stackmap format, but it does not explicitly mention reducing power consumption or resource usage for environmental reasons. It only states what the code does and its intended use without providing direct evidence of why it was designed this way in terms of energy efficiency goals. The reasoning provided by the AI is flawed because it infers benefits (energy savings) from features that are unrelated to minimizing computing resources directly, such as using a default address space or having reasonable relocation semantics. These do not inherently relate to reducing electricity consumption; they could be for other reasons like memory management or performance optimization. Therefore, this does not meet the principle of direct evidence and should be classified as false positive."

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope &amp; Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the content as a true positive for 'integrability'. The source text describes contributing guidelines and mentions adaptation from other guides, but it does not explicitly describe why the design choices relate to integrability. It only states that parts are adapted, which is an indirect reference at best. According to Step 2 of the original prompt, direct evidence requires explaining *why* the code is designed for a non-functional goal like integrability. The AI's reasoning fails this criterion by inferring integrability from adaptation without clear justification in the text. Additionally, while the content might be related to software documentation (Step 1 passes), it does not directly address component design or API mechanisms that enable pluggable integration—a key aspect of integrability per Step 3. The output is therefore incorrect."

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** security

**2. Attribute Description:** Security is the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorised access or manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for legitimate users.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on protection against malicious actors. Strong examples will explicitly mention a security threat (e.g., injection attack, unauthorized access) or a security mechanism (e.g., encryption, input sanitization, authentication).

**4. Content to Analyze:** The use case in question is like this:. For reasons of cross-validation, it has become a customary technique within ATLAS (and probably other collaborations as well) to construct a Hybrid Dataset"", that is equal to the real data in the control regions, but only contains asimov data in the signal region (""partically unblinded""). If you want to have both the Hybrid Dataset and the Dataset in the same workspace to reduce the bookkeeping and turnaround time of the unblinding procedure (first only look at hybrid data, and if the fit to hybrid data looks okay, also look at real data), the most convenient way to do this would be to include it from the get-go using this feature, rather than having to somehow construct or import it down the line when the workspace already exists, or to maintain two completely different workspaces that have the same model and only different datasets.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope &amp; Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope &amp; Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Lower llvm.expect to metadata before attempting transforms. Compare/branch metadata may alter the behavior of passes like SimplifyCFG.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the source text as a true positive for testability. The source text does not describe a quality attribute (testability) but rather discusses compiler transformations and potential side effects on code behavior, which falls under describing functionality or technical operations. It lacks explicit reasoning about why these actions are taken to improve testability; instead, it focuses on implementation details without connecting them directly to non-functional goals like ease of testing."
