You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

    <reasoning>This appears to be a command-line instruction or filter specification.

The content lacks any natural language narrative, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion intended for humans.</reasoning>
    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the source text as to be eliminated. The source text is a command-line instruction that specifies filtering certain macros (__arm_cdp, __arm_ldcl, __arm_stcl) from arm_acle.h. According to the original prompt, content should be kept if it consists of meaningful human-written prose or technical discussion intended for developers. This instruction appears to be part of a configuration or build process and is formatted as a command (starting with 'Filter'). It lacks significant natural language narrative or explanation; instead, it's a directive that would typically be executed by a program. The prompt explicitly states that even if embedded in technical artifacts, content should be kept if it has substance and intent for human readers. However, this output is primarily a technical artifact (a filter command) without any explanatory text around it. Therefore, the AI failed to recognize that this could potentially contain human-written analysis or discussion about filtering these macros, but more importantly, it's not clear from the source alone whether there was any human intent behind writing this line. The instruction seems too brief and lacks context for being considered meaningful prose. It should be evaluated based on its substance: is it a communication intended for developers? This appears to be an automated process description rather than human analysis. Hence, according to the prompt's rules, since it lacks significant natural language narrative or explanation, it should be eliminated. But wait, let me re-read the examples and criteria carefully.

The original prompt says: 'Keep Content That... Includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions.' The source text is a single line that might be part of a larger context (like comments in code) but as presented, it's just an instruction. However, note that Example 5 kept content with documentation tags because it provided explanation and recommendation.

But this output does not have any narrative or analysis; it's simply stating what to filter. The prompt requires the substance to be a human-written communication. This line doesn't seem to offer any insight or discussion—it is purely an action specification without justification or context. Therefore, according to the criteria, since it lacks significant natural language narrative, explanation, etc., and is primarily composed of non-prose technical artifact (a filter command), it should be eliminated.

However, I notice that in Example 5, they kept content with tags because there was a detailed explanation following it. In this case, the source text does not have any such explanation—it's just one line: 'Filter __arm_cdp, __arm_ldcl, __arm_stcl in arm_acle.h'. This is similar to Example 2 which eliminated pure executable code or formal syntax without comments.

But wait, let me check if this could be a comment. The source text says it's from arm_acle.h and the format suggests it might be part of a header file with some directives. However, there's no indication that this is human-written prose—it appears to be an instruction for filtering macros, which would typically be done by automated tools or scripts.

The AI's reasoning states: 'This appears to be a command-line instruction or filter specification.' But the source text doesn't specify it's from a command line; it just says it's in arm_acle.h. The key is whether there is human-written analysis, not necessarily that it's from a specific format.

Moreover, note that Example 4 kept a bug report because it described and analyzed the issue. This source text does not describe or analyze anything—it simply states what to filter. There might be an implied reason for filtering (e.g., these are unused functions), but without any explanation provided in the content itself, we cannot assume that.

Therefore, based on the strict criteria of lacking significant natural language narrative and being primarily a technical artifact, this should indeed be eliminated."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated (to_eliminate: True). However, upon analysis of the source text and prompt rules, this content is a stack trace which includes technical artifacts but also contains elements that could reflect human communication if properly analyzed. The source text describes a sequence of function calls with memory addresses, which are typical in debugging scenarios. According to the prompt, we should keep scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions even when embedded in technical artifacts. This content is part of a larger system (Cling) and describes execution flow, but it lacks explicit human analysis or commentary. The AI's reasoning states that there is no natural language narrative, which aligns with the elimination criteria for 'pure executable code' without explanation. However, the prompt also includes keeping examples like commit messages and bug reports if they contain discussion. This stack trace does not have any surrounding human analysis; it is presented as a raw technical artifact. Therefore, while technically accurate in being primarily non-prose programmatic artifacts (as per elimination criteria), the AI's classification might be too strict because the prompt allows keeping content that reflects communication intended for developers or users if there is significant natural language explanation. But note: The examples provided do not include stack traces as keepable unless they contain narrative. In this case, it lacks any narrative and is purely a technical artifact without explanatory text. Hence, eliminating it seems correct."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

However, upon analysis of the source text and prompt rules, this content should indeed be eliminated. The source text describes a tool's implementation details, optimization passes, and interface issues but lacks significant natural language narrative or explanation intended for human readers. It is primarily composed of technical artifacts without substantial human-written prose discussing trade-offs or providing meaningful insights. For instance, it mentions specific reduction techniques (e.g., discarding functions, removing unused parameters) but does not explain them in a way that reflects communication for developers; instead, it reads like an internal specification document. The prompt requires keeping content with significant natural language explanation, which is absent here."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content. The provided source text includes a detailed explanation of an uninitialized value issue in ROOT software, specifically mentioning that it was created by a stack allocation and pointing to `AddTree` calling into `AddDataset`. It also provides a reproducer command for Valgrind and references a specific line in the DataLoader.cxx file. This content contains significant natural language narrative discussing technical details, potential causes (stack allocation), and even includes a suggested fix or reproducer. The reasoning provided by the AI is flawed because it fails to recognize that this text includes human analysis of the issue, such as explaining where the problem might be located (`AddTree` ultimately calls into `AddDataset`) and how to reproduce it. According to the original prompt's rules, content with scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions should be kept even if embedded in artifacts.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the given source text as to be eliminated. The original prompt requires evaluating whether content should be filtered out based on specific criteria for keeping meaningful human-written prose or technical discussion with substance and intent.

First, analyze the goal: The task is to keep content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion intended for human readers (developers or users). Technical artifacts are kept if they contain such natural language elements.

Now, examine the source text: ""Copy a string into the Document's strings list, and return the copy that is owned by the Document.""
This sentence describes an API method or function in technical terms. It includes formal language about programmatic operations (copying a string, interacting with a strings list). According to the prompt rules, content like this should be kept if it reflects communication intended for developers or users and contains significant natural language explanation.

The AI's reasoning states: ""This appears to be a description of an API method or function. It lists technical artifacts (strings list) without providing detailed explanation or analysis."" However, the prompt explicitly includes content that is embedded within technical artifacts but has human-written narrative as something to keep. Example 5 shows how even tagged documentation can be kept if it provides explanations.

Moreover, this sentence does contain natural language and describes a function's behavior (copying a string and returning ownership). It could be part of an API documentation intended for developers who are implementing or using the Document class. The key is that it has substance: explaining what the operation does in terms understandable to humans involved with the system.

Therefore, despite being technical, this content should not be eliminated because it provides a meaningful description and explanation relevant to developers. It meets the criteria of having significant natural language narrative about implementation strategies or trade-offs (even if indirectly). The AI's conclusion is wrong."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content when it should be kept. The source text contains a detailed list of compiler flags and include paths, which is technical in nature but lacks human-written narrative or explanation. However, according to the prompt rules, such technical artifacts are to be eliminated only if they lack significant natural language discussion. In this case, there is no prose at all; it's purely a specification of build settings (like Makefile or configuration files). The AI correctly identified that it lacks narrative but failed to recognize that even pure technical specifications should be filtered out only when lacking explanation—here, the entire content is devoid of any natural language. Therefore, since the substance is not human-written communication and there's no intent for developers/users beyond just specifying build settings (which are low-value without analysis), this content must be eliminated as per Example 6 in the prompt. But wait: Example 6 shows eliminating a changelog that lacks narrative or detailed explanation of reasons. This source text doesn't have any narrative—it's purely technical artifacts with no explanatory comments. The AI correctly states it lacks natural language, but according to the rules, if there is no significant natural language at all (as in this case), then it should be eliminated regardless of whether it has a narrative or not? Let me re-read: Keep Content That includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions even embedded within artifacts. But here, there's nothing about discussion—just raw specifications. The AI says to eliminate because it lacks natural language narrative, which is correct reasoning based on the rules. However, I must check if all fields are present and justified.

Looking at the output: `to_eliminate` is set to true (correct decision) but wait no—the prompt asks for elimination when lacking significant natural language discussion. The AI says it lacks any narrative or analysis—so that part seems correct. But then why did I mark incorrect? Let's compare with examples.

Example 2 eliminates a list of API functions because they lack human-written narrative. Similarly, this content is just a long string of technical specifications without explanation. So the reasoning should be: it lacks significant natural language discussion and is primarily non-prose programmatic artifacts (like build flags). Therefore, `to_eliminate` true seems correct.

But wait—the AI output says to eliminate because it lacks narrative, which aligns with Example 2. However, in my initial thought I said incorrect but then realized the reasoning matches the elimination criteria. Let me re-analyze strictly.

The prompt's keep criteria include technical discussions even embedded within artifacts (like code comments). But this content has no natural language—just a list of flags and paths. It is purely configuration data, similar to Example 6 which was eliminated because it lacked narrative or detailed explanation. The AI correctly identifies that there is no narrative, so elimination seems appropriate.

However, the prompt says: Eliminate if primarily composed of non-prose programmatic artifacts lacking significant natural language. This content has no natural language at all—every part is a technical artifact (paths and flags). So it should be eliminated because it lacks any human-written substance. The AI's reasoning matches this.

But wait, the prompt also says: Keep even if embedded within or formatted as technical artifacts—but only if there is significant natural language discussion. Here, no such discussion exists—just a string of specifications. Therefore, elimination is correct.

So why did I think incorrect? Because in my first thought I confused it with something that might have embedded text but doesn't. But the AI output correctly eliminates this content because it lacks any narrative or explanation. The reasoning provided by the AI is accurate: no human-written prose beyond technical artifacts, and these are low-value without analysis.

Therefore, the evaluation should be `correct`."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies `to_eliminate` as false. However, the reasoning provided is flawed because it does not properly analyze the source text according to the prompt rules. The original prompt requires evaluating whether content should be filtered out (eliminated) or kept based on its being human-written prose with explanation/analysis for developers/users. In this case, the sentence in question appears to describe a technical concept but lacks sufficient context and clarity about what 'legal vector types' and 'lane types' refer to. It does not clearly explain implementation strategies or trade-offs without relying on undefined terms. The AI's reasoning incorrectly assumes that any mention of technical optimization qualifies for keeping when the prompt emphasizes substantial explanation, analysis, or discussion intended for human readers. This output fails to meet the criteria because it is too vague and lacks grounding in specific facts from the source text."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content when it should be kept. According to the original prompt, we must keep content that includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions even if embedded in code artifacts. The provided source text contains a diff hunk with changes for build scripts (e.g., updating Bazel version) and function definitions (. note_build_stage). These elements are technical but include explanatory comments such as 'Install the runtime packages' and instructions that reflect human communication about implementation strategies. For instance, the else block in ensure_wanted_bazel_version shows a method to install Bazel with specific steps and rationale (e.g., using curl and chmod), which is an example of detailed technical discussion intended for developers. The AI's reasoning fails to recognize these aspects as they are embedded within code-like structures but still convey human analysis. Therefore, the content should not be eliminated."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The provided source text is a fragment: '<allowed ranges for cut optimisation for the use of the binary tree method>'. According to the original prompt, we must keep content that consists of significant natural language and explanation if it reflects communication intended for human readers. This fragment does contain some technical terminology but lacks sufficient context or narrative to be considered meaningful human-written prose. However, the AI's reasoning states that it is an incomplete statement lacking context and resembles a comment header without providing analysis. While this might be partially true, I must reevaluate based on strict adherence to prompt rules.

The original prompt requires keeping content with significant natural language explanation or discussion intended for developers/users. This fragment does not provide such substance; it's too brief and lacks the narrative element expected in human-to-human communication. Therefore, according to the elimination criteria (lacking a significant natural language narrative), this should be eliminated.

But wait: The AI output has 'to_eliminate' set to true, which aligns with my assessment. However, I must check if all fields are present and justified. In the original prompt's evaluation task, we need to judge whether the content is meaningful human-written prose or not. This fragment does not meet that criterion because it lacks a narrative structure and detailed explanation—it's just a technical phrase without any analysis or commentary.

Moreover, the AI correctly identified that this resembles a comment header (which could be eliminated) but failed to note that even if embedded in code, as long as there is substantial prose, we keep it. However, here there isn't enough substance for human readers; it's too minimalistic and lacks intent or discussion.

Therefore, the AI was correct in eliminating this content."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The source text is ""OpenMP target teams distribute parallel for directive"", which appears to describe a programming construct (specifically, an OpenMP directive). According to the original prompt, we should keep scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions even if they are embedded in technical artifacts. However, this content does not contain any natural language narrative, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion—it is simply stating what the directive is without providing any context, reasoning, or human insight. It also lacks a significant ratio of prose to code; it's purely declarative and technical. The AI correctly identified that there is no substantial human-written text here, but misapplied the rule by concluding that this should be eliminated when in fact, based on the criteria provided, content like this should be kept if it reflects communication intended for developers or users about implementation strategies or trade-offs. In this case, while it's technical and lacks narrative, it is still a detailed technical discussion of an OpenMP feature (a parallelization directive). The prompt explicitly states to keep such discussions even when embedded in technical artifacts. Therefore, the AI should have set `to_eliminate` to false because there is no requirement to eliminate purely technical descriptions as long as they are substantial and intended for human readers."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated (`to_eliminate` is false). However, the reasoning provided does not fully align with the prompt's rules. The source text discusses a development strategy (splitting PRs) and future actions (rebasing), which falls under 'communication intended for developers' as per the Keep criteria. But the AI's reasoning only mentions 'natural language discussion about development process', without explicitly referencing the specific elements from the original prompt that justify keeping it, such as being embedded within technical artifacts or containing analysis of implementation strategies. Additionally, while the content does contain natural language, it is not purely prose but includes references to a PR and commit actions, which are version control metadata. According to the Eliminate criteria, if there's no explanatory narrative around these technical elements, they might be considered for elimination. The AI missed this nuance by focusing solely on the presence of natural language without assessing whether it provides sufficient explanation or commentary."

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the given content as to be eliminated (to_eliminate: True). According to the original prompt, we should keep content that includes significant natural language and explanation. The provided source text is a technical specification using angle brackets and symbols like 'u&lt;length&gt;i&lt;type size&gt;', which describes how integer types are normalized in vendor extended formats. This falls under scientific or detailed technical discussions (as per the Keep criteria). However, the AI's reasoning fails to recognize that this content contains formal technical language intended for developers, discussing specific encoding strategies and their structure. The prompt explicitly states that even if embedded within technical artifacts, human-written analysis should be kept as long as there is substance. In contrast, the examples given in the prompt (like Example 2) show similar technical specifications being eliminated because they lack narrative or explanation. But note: the key difference here is intent and substance. The source text does not have natural language prose but consists of a formal description that could be intended for developers familiar with this encoding scheme. Since it reflects communication intended for developers (as per Keep criteria) about implementation strategies, it should not necessarily be eliminated. Therefore, the AI's classification as 'to_eliminate: True' is incorrect because it misjudged the intent and substance of the content."

The source text describes a build process with specific commands and paths, but crucially includes references to testing strategies (e.g., 'I tested the new parallelization strategy') which is human-written analysis. However, upon closer inspection, the provided content does not contain any such narrative; it's purely technical specifications for compilation without explanatory prose. The AI correctly identified that there is no significant natural language narrative or explanation in this text. But wait, let me re-read my own reasoning - I just contradicted myself by saying 'according to the original prompt' but then stated incorrectly about testing strategies being present. Actually, upon reviewing the source_text again, it does not mention any testing strategy or analysis; it's a log of build commands and dependencies. The AI correctly classified this as eliminate because there is no human-written narrative explaining implementation trade-offs or other insights. However, I initially misjudged by thinking about example 3 which had different content. So the correct evaluation should be that the output is 'correct' since the reasoning aligns with eliminating purely technical artifacts without explanatory text."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The `to_eliminate` field is correctly set to false, as the content does contain natural language explanation and analysis. However, the reasoning provided by the AI output is flawed because it misinterprets the source text's reference to '-reassociation' as a command-line option or feature (e.g., 'handling more generally in -reassociation'). The original prompt requires filtering based on whether the content consists of meaningful human-written prose and reflects communication for developers/users. While the reasoning mentions implementation strategy, it incorrectly assumes that technical artifacts like '-reassociation' are being discussed without evidence from the source text. In fact, the source text does not specify what '-reassociation' refers to; it is a vague reference that could be an artifact or documentation. The AI's output should have focused on the substance of the content: it explains a special case handling and suggests potential improvements (handling more generally), but without clarifying what these terms mean in context, the reasoning remains unsubstantiated."

- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that `to_eliminate` should be false. However, its reasoning is flawed in several ways:

1. The prompt requires keeping content that reflects communication intended for developers or users and includes technical discussions. The source text does discuss CI flags and GitHub behavior, which are technical topics.
2. But the AI's reasoning incorrectly labels this as `speculation about future capabilities`. While there is a question (`Very curious...`), it doesn't constitute pure speculation without evidence; rather, it's an inquiry into current or potential system changes.
3. The prompt explicitly states that even if embedded in technical artifacts (like code comments) the substance and intent matter. This text explains how `pull_request` and `pull_request_target` work technically, which is a detailed explanation of implementation strategies.
4. However, the AI's reasoning fails to properly analyze all aspects: it doesn't mention the lack of programmatic artifact or purely technical content without narrative, but instead focuses on speculation which isn't clearly present in the source text as per the prompt rules."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
run specified on the. command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to. search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all. tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number. of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The. :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests. fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only. print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for. options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are. executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See. :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a. subset of the options specified on the command line, see. :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after. parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for. supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`. by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as. inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

    <reasoning>This content is a detailed documentation of the `lit` program's usage and options, including explanations for various features and references to other sections.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as not being eliminated. The source text is a technical documentation excerpt for `lit` program, consisting of formal descriptions and references to other sections (like :ref:`test-discovery`). It lacks significant natural language narrative or human-written analysis beyond describing features without explaining reasons or trade-offs. According to the prompt's rules, content that is primarily composed of non-prose artifacts should be eliminated unless it contains substantial explanation. This text does not meet the criteria for keeping because it is mostly technical documentation with minimal unique insight or discussion."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The rest is similar to https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/514#issuecomment-1035630725 , but with v1.5.0. ```. Pull the image. BIN_VERSION=1.5.0. singularity pull docker://google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}-gpu"". Run DeepVariant. Using --nv and ${BIN_VERSION}-gpu is important. singularity run --nv -B /usr/lib/locale/:/usr/lib/locale/ \. docker://google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}-gpu \. /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \. --model_type=WGS \. --ref=""${INPUT_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta \. --reads=""${INPUT_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam \. --regions chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000 \. --output_vcf=""${OUTPUT_DIR}""/output.vcf.gz \. --output_gvcf=""${OUTPUT_DIR}""/output.g.vcf.gz \. --intermediate_results_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR}/intermediate_results_dir \. --num_shards=$(nproc). ```.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as not to be eliminated. The provided source text is: 'Order by descending set size.

However, according to the original prompt's rules, content should be kept if it consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers and reflects communication for developers or users. In this case, the source text does contain natural language (e.g., 'Order by descending set size', 'Note that...', etc.), but it is not primarily a narrative or discussion; rather, it seems to be an instruction or comment within a technical context. The AI's reasoning incorrectly assumes that because the content was provided in English and contains some explanation-like elements, it should be kept. But this does not align with the prompt's criteria for keeping content: it must have significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion. Here, the text is more of a directive (like an instruction to sort something) than substantial prose. Moreover, the AI's reasoning introduces irrelevant details about being a beginner student and creating an API for C++17 which are not related to the evaluation task at all.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content when it should be kept. According to the original prompt, we must keep content that includes significant natural language explanation or analysis even if embedded in technical artifacts. The source text contains detailed comments about code execution paths (e.g., 'Taking true branch', 'Assuming len is <= 2'), which are forms of human-written analysis and commentary on implementation strategies. These descriptions reflect communication intended for developers, explaining conditions and branches taken during program execution. Additionally, the content references specific files and line numbers but includes narrative elements that discuss assumptions made by the code (e.g., about memory usage). The AI's reasoning fails to recognize these explanatory components as meeting the criteria for keeping; it incorrectly labels them as lacking a natural language narrative simply because they are technical artifacts."

[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Content to evaluate:**
Hi! Thanks for opening the issue. I have first added the `priority-high` label because it appeared like a usecase that worked in 6.24 was broken in 6.26, but I don't this is the case. Yes, the normalization was not off in 6.24, but the fit gave nonsensical results anyway for different reasons also in 6.24. Or did you manage to make this shifted RooHistPdf work in any ROOT version? To me, the result of your script looks like this both in ROOT 6.24 and in ROOT `master` (upcoming 6.28, where the normalization issue got fixed by the way):. ![plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6578603/203787998-2652e495-f6b6-4d54-a2fc-64c66a96ac8a.png). I modified your script a bit to have more events in the toy dataset, and fixed the plotting order (you got to plot the data always the very first, otherwise the PDFs will not be scaled correctly). I think the best we can do now to support your usecase is this:. 1. Since shifting a RooHistPdf doesn't work in any ROOT version, I implement a custom PDF class that can do that which you can readily use. 2. For the upcoming ROOT 6.28, we will also make sure that the actual RooHistPdf support the shift. 3. About this issue with the normalization in 6.26, I'm not sure if it's worth it to address this since the problem is gone in ROOT 6.28 which will be released soon. Anyway, the problem only appears for models where the fit result was also wrong before for other reasons, so that temporary regression in 6.26 probably didn't break any existing usecase. Does that make sense to you?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

It includes natural language explanation, which falls under the criteria for keeping: \""Includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions, even if highly formal or specialized.\"" The text also reflects communication intended for developers, discussing implementation aspects like build process considerations.

Next, scrutinize the AI's output:
- `to_eliminate` is set to True in the output, but according to my analysis of the source content, it should be False because there is significant natural language and technical discussion present. The reasoning provided by the AI seems completely unrelated: it starts with a reference to Linux kernel versions and then talks about API keys, commit messages, user-defined functions, and text-to-something transformations. This has no connection to the original prompt or the source content.

Therefore, since the main decision in the output is wrong (it incorrectly classifies this technical description as something to eliminate), the entire output must be judged incorrect."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:

Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated (`to_eliminate` is false). However, its reasoning contains inaccuracies. The source text includes a personal note with gratitude and reflections on past experiences, which does contain natural language narrative and analysis about technical clarity (porting DeepVariant). But the prompt requires checking if there's significant human-written prose or explanation intended for developers/users. While the content has some discussion, it is not purely technical; it mixes polite acknowledgment with technical insight. The AI's reasoning states 'it contains natural language narrative and analysis', which aligns somewhat but fails to note that the text includes non-technical elements (like thanking specific individuals). According to the prompt rules, even if embedded in artifacts or formatted simply, content is kept if it has substance and intent for human readers. This output does not fully justify keeping the content because it overlooks the lack of purely technical focus; the gratitude part dilutes its primary purpose as a communication artifact."

PyROOT incorrect/unstable overload resolution with enum class.; With master (commit 7f3f3428e4d20) (but has been present for a long time), PyROOT overload resolution of function that takes an enum class is unstable (it appears to depend on the value rather than the type). With the test file below compiled by ACLiC (for example) running the script:. ```python. import ROOT. ROOT.gSystem.Load(""enums_cxx""). h = ROOT.Holder(). for i in range(10, 0, -1):. h.SetTwo(i). ROOT.to_string(h.two). ```. gives. ```txt. Calling to_string for enum EOne with 0. Calling to_string for enum EOne with 1. ... ```. I.e. even-though the argument is an enum ETwo', the overload take an `enum EOne` actually called. In the original example (requires the code for Celeritas and VecGeom to build). For a similar script:. ```python. for i in range(0, 14, 1):. p.process_class = i. ROOT.celeritas.to_cstring(p.process_class). ```. I get:. ```txt. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 0 unknown. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 1 linear. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 2 log. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 3 free. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 4 ionisation_subsec. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 5 csda_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 6 range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 7 secondary_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 8 inverse_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 9 lambda. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 10 sublambda. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 11 lambda_prim. to_cstring ImportProcessType called with 12 ucn. to_cstring ImportProcessClass called with 13 annihilation. ```. i.e. the *same* code line given the *same* data members (and thus always the *same* type), call 3 different overloads over the loop iterations. (Funnily running the loop in reverse order leads to the expected/correct executions). I could not reproduce this instability with my simple example. . ```c++. in

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**

So DeepVariant first picks candidates by going through the regions of the genome you specify, and are also in your BAM file.

For each of these pieces of information it can only fit 100 rows of it, as the model operates optimally with only a height of ~100, and was trained as such.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The provided source text is a list of test coverage metrics for different Clang components, with each entry having numbers and percentages (e.g., `1`, `1`, `0` followed by `:good:` or `:part:`). According to the original prompt's rules, we must keep content that includes significant natural language explanation or analysis. However, this output does not analyze any specific part of the source text; it merely states its overall structure without providing substantive reasoning based on the examples given in the prompt.

The AI fails to properly evaluate each component as per Example 5 which shows keeping content even if embedded within technical artifacts if there is a narrative or explanation. In this case, the output does not break down any specific entry for human analysis but treats it as purely technical data without justification from the examples provided in the prompt.

Moreover, the AI's reasoning does not align with Example 3 which keeps content that explains trade-offs and suggests improvements. Here, no such explanation is present or implied by the output."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that this content should be eliminated, but its reasoning does not fully align with the prompt's rules. The source text is an error message: 'error: The last gc run reported the following. Please correct the root cause. should be fixed.' According to the original prompt, we must keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users and includes significant natural language explanation. This error message does contain a call to action ('Please correct the root cause') which is human-written prose aimed at technical readers (developers). However, it lacks detailed analysis or discussion of the issue. The AI's reasoning states that there is 'no substantive explanation,' but this content does include an instruction for correction, which falls under communication intended for developers as per prompt rule 3: 'Includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions.' Although brief, the error message serves to communicate a problem and direct action, making it eligible for keeping. The AI's classification is incorrect because the prompt explicitly states that program output, logs, or error traces should be kept if they are accompanied by human analysis. This example lacks any surrounding explanation but still contains an instruction that could be considered meaningful communication for technical readers."

</evaluation_data>
",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated (to_eliminate: false) because it contains human-written analysis on coding standards. However, the reasoning provided by the AI is flawed in several ways:

1. The AI states that the text includes ""analysis on readability trade-offs and references to community consensus"", but this is not fully supported by the source text.
   - While there are mentions of trade-offs (e.g., switching standard makes it easier for new code, but harms existing code) and some references to acronyms being valuable, these points are embedded within a technical discussion that primarily lists coding conventions without substantial explanation or commentary. The analysis is superficial as the text does not provide detailed reasoning about why readability matters or what specific trade-offs exist beyond stating they occur.

2. The AI claims there is ""human-written explanation"" and ""natural language prose discussing pros and cons, recommendations, and examples from different contexts"", but this misinterprets the source content.
   - The text does contain some discussion (e.g., about using non-acronym names being easier for new code) but it lacks depth. It also includes a table listing class names and variable names with acronyms, which is more of a technical artifact than narrative prose. While there are references to projects like WebKit, Mozilla, etc., these are used as citations without providing meaningful human analysis.

3. The AI's reasoning does not fully align with the prompt's criteria for keeping content.
   - According to the prompt, we should keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users and includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions. However, this text is more of a summary of coding standards rather than a detailed discussion. It lacks unique insights or deep analysis beyond what might be found in standard documentation.

Therefore, while the primary decision (to_eliminate: false) aligns with keeping content that has natural language and explanation, the reasoning provided by the AI does not fully justify this verdict as it oversimplifies the source text's substance."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The provided source text is a sentence from what appears to be code documentation or comments, describing an event handler function and its trigger condition (when F3 is clicked with locator). According to the original prompt rules, we should keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users, including technical artifacts if they contain significant natural language explanation. The source text does include a narrative about what the member function does when triggered, which meets the criteria for keeping it. However, the AI's reasoning incorrectly states that this lacks substantial natural language and is merely a technical artifact without meaningful context. In fact, the sentence itself describes functionality in a way that could be intended for developers understanding the code behavior. The prompt explicitly allows keeping content embedded within or formatted as technical artifacts if there is significant natural language explanation. Therefore, despite being technically worded, this should not be eliminated because it provides an explanation of how the system responds to user actions (F3 click)."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in. several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a. starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual. ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The. ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to. get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple. values, values which are not :ref:`constants &lt;constants&gt;` are all. defined within the same function. Representation of Pointers. --------------------------. Most importantly, the ``AliasAnalysis`` class provides several methods which are. used to query whether or not two memory objects alias, whether function calls. can modify or read a memory object, etc. For all of these queries, memory. objects are represented as a pair of their starting address (a symbolic LLVM. ``Value*``) and a static size. Representing memory objects as a starting address and a size is critically. important for correct Alias Analyses. For example, consider this (silly, but. possible) C code:. .. code-block:: c++. int i;. char C[2];. char A[10];. /* ... */. for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {. C

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

    <reasoning>This content appears to be a documentation or help text snippet from ROOT software, describing features and functionalities related to visualization and unit systems.

</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the content as to be eliminated (True). According to the original prompt, we should keep content that includes significant natural language explanation or discussion. The provided source text is a detailed description of ROOT software features, including user interactions and system units. It contains substantial technical details but also human-readable prose explaining these features. For instance, it describes actions like click-and-drag for rotation, key presses for zooming, and right-click commands for various functions (e.g., SetParallel/SetPerspective). Additionally, there is a section on selecting the system of units in ROOT with historical context and rationale.

The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that this content meets the criteria for keeping. It states: ""While it contains some natural language elements, the majority is structured as technical artifacts (lists of actions, method names) without substantial human-written explanation or analysis."" However, upon closer inspection, the text does provide explanations and discussions about how these features work and their purposes.

Specifically:
- The first part explains user interactions with the canvas and volumes.
- It details various commands and what they do (e.g., J/K for zooming).
- There is a narrative on selecting units, mentioning historical context and reasons for change.

Therefore, this content should not be eliminated. The AI's verdict of True for to_eliminate is incorrect because the source text includes meaningful human-written prose that explains technical functionalities in a way intended for users or developers."

to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated (to_eliminate: true). The original prompt requires evaluating whether the target content should be filtered out, meaning it must determine if the content is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts lacking significant natural language narrative. However, in this case, the source text 'Rewrite all the loads in the loop and remember all the definitions from stores in the loop' does contain elements that could be interpreted as instructions for developers (e.g., regarding code optimization). It is a concise statement about programmatic actions but lacks detailed explanation or analysis. According to the prompt's rules, content like this should be kept if it reflects communication intended for developers or users, such as thoughtful suggestions or critiques. The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that even though the text is brief, its intent and substance are relevant to human readers in a technical context. Therefore, the classification 'to_eliminate: true' is incorrect because the content does not meet the criteria for elimination; it has some natural language component but is still an instruction meant for developers."

 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should be eliminated, but its reasoning is flawed. The source text appears to be a log from a pip installation attempt, which includes technical artifacts (commands and error messages). However, according to the prompt, elimination occurs when there is no significant natural language narrative or explanation. In this case, while it lacks deep analysis, it does contain some human-readable elements like 'install --record', 'got version from file', etc., which are part of a build process description. The AI's reasoning states that it lacks any natural language narrative, but the content itself has technical commentary (e.g., about installation steps and errors). Therefore, while the primary decision to eliminate might be correct based on the examples provided, the justification is not fully grounded in the prompt rules because there are some elements of human communication present. The AI should have noted that even though it's embedded in a log format, if it contains significant natural language explanation or discussion about technical trade-offs or implementation strategies, it would be kept. Here, the content lacks such substance and focuses purely on programmatic artifacts."

While the majority of the content consists of terminal commands (non-prose technical artifacts), there is some human-written context: 'Reproducer:' suggests this is intended for developers, and 'and it hangs' indicates analysis. The prompt requires keeping content that has substantial natural language explanation or discussion even if embedded in technical artifacts. In this case, the AI's reasoning fails to recognize that the phrase 'PR coming up' might imply a human communication element (e.g., about preparing a pull request), but overall, the classification is correct because the primary substance is technical commands without sufficient analysis as per Example 1 and 2."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should be eliminated, but it fails to fully justify this decision according to the prompt rules. The source text is a list of file paths from LLDB's source code directory. According to the original prompt, we must filter out content that is primarily composed of non-prose programmatic artifacts lacking significant natural language narrative. While the AI notes that there is no natural language narrative, it does not sufficiently analyze whether this qualifies as a technical artifact under the criteria provided in the prompt.

The prompt specifies that technical artifacts should be eliminated if they lack explanatory comments or narratives. The given content consists of file names and paths (e.g., 'y/x86/UnwindAssembly-x86.h' and 'lldb/source/Symbol/ArmUnwindInfo.cpp'), which are typical in software development for listing source files.

However, the prompt also states that even if embedded within technical artifacts, content with significant natural language explanation should be kept. In this case, there is no such explanation present. The reasoning provided by the AI is accurate but incomplete because it does not reference all relevant aspects of the evaluation criteria."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**

TriMap: Large-scale Dimensionality Reduction Using Triplets [Amid and Warmuth, 2019]. TriMap is a dimensionality reduction method that uses triplet constraints. to form a low-dimensional embedding of a set of points. The triplet. constraints are of the form “point i is closer to point j than point k”. The triplets are sampled from the high-dimensional representation of the. points and a weighting scheme is used to reflect the importance of each. triplet. TriMap provides a significantly better global view of the data than the. other dimensionality reduction methods such t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP.

According to the original prompt, content should be kept if it includes significant natural language explanation or discussion intended for human readers. The provided source text contains a detailed description of TriMap (TriMap) including its purpose, methodology, and comparison with other methods like t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP. This is substantive technical discussion that meets the criteria for keeping content. Even though it includes API documentation elements, the core explanation about TriMap's functionality qualifies as human-written analysis of implementation strategies and trade-offs."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly eliminates the content, but according to the prompt's rules, this list of file paths is a technical artifact. However, it does not meet the elimination criteria because it lacks significant natural language narrative or explanation. The prompt states that we should filter out content that is primarily composed of non-prose programmatic artifacts without explanatory narrative. This list is purely enumerating files and directories, which fits into being eliminated only if there's no human analysis. But note: Example 2 (Eliminate) shows a similar situation where a list of API functions was eliminated because it lacked any human-written narrative or explanation. In this case, the content to evaluate is also just a list of file paths without any natural language discussion. Therefore, according to the rules in the original prompt, since there's no significant natural language narrative, it should be filtered out (to_eliminate: true). However, the AI output has `to_eliminate` set to True and reasoning that matches this conclusion. But wait, let me recheck the evaluation criteria.

The evaluation task requires determining if the <ai_output_to_verify> is a correct application of the rules in the original prompt. The main decision or classification must be checked against the source text and prompt's instructions.
The AI output says to_eliminate: True with reasoning that it lacks natural language narrative, which aligns with the elimination criteria (see 'Eliminate' section). However, I need to verify if this is correct according to the rules. The content provided in <source_text> is a list of file paths and names from the LLVM project's source code structure. This does not contain any meaningful human-written prose or explanation; it's just technical artifacts (file listings) without narrative.

According to the prompt, we should keep content that includes significant natural language, explanation, etc., but this lacks all of those elements. It is purely a list of files and directories, which falls under 'pure executable code or formal syntax' if considered as part of source code structure? Actually, it's more about being a file listing than pure code.

But note: the prompt says to filter out content that is primarily composed of non-prose programmatic artifacts. This list does not have any prose at all; it's just technical names and paths. So according to the rules, this should be eliminated (to_eliminate: true).
The AI output correctly concludes to_eliminate: True with appropriate reasoning. However, I notice that in my initial thought I said 'incorrect' but then realized it was correct. Let me reevaluate strictly.

The original prompt's elimination criteria include content lacking significant natural language narrative or explanation. The source text is a list of file paths and names without any such narrative. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be eliminated (to_eliminate: true).
The AI output has `to_eliminate` set to True and provides reasoning that matches the prompt's elimination criteria. So it seems correct.

But wait, there is a nuance in the prompt: 'Crucially: This content should be kept even if it is embedded within or formatted as technical artifacts.' However, this list does not have any natural language narrative; it's purely technical artifact without explanatory text. Therefore, it meets the elimination criteria.

Also, compare to Example 2 where a similar list of API functions was eliminated because it lacked human analysis. Here, we have a list of files and directories from LLVM tools/libraries, which is also lacking any natural language narrative or explanation. So the reasoning provided by the AI seems accurate."

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
Set up the pipeline like llc does.

    </original_prompt>
    
    <ai_output_to_verify>
        <to_eliminate>True</to_eliminate>
    <reasoning>This is an instruction that refers to another tool (llc) without providing any detailed explanation, analysis, or discussion. It lacks substantive human-written prose and instead serves as a directive pointing to external technical artifacts.</reasoning>
    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content 'Set up the pipeline like llc does.' according to the rules in the original prompt. The prompt requires evaluating whether the target content should be filtered out (i.e., eliminated). However, the examples provided show that content with instructions or references to other tools can still be kept if it contains meaningful human-written prose and explanation.

In this case, the source text is a simple instruction: 'Set up the pipeline like llc does.' It lacks detailed natural language narrative, analysis, or discussion. But according to the prompt's rules, we should keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users, such as thoughtful suggestions or explanations of implementation strategies.

The AI's reasoning states that it is eliminating because there is no detailed explanation, but this does not align with the examples. Example 5 kept a content that used documentation tags and provided recommendations, which are forms of human-written analysis even if embedded in technical artifacts. Similarly, example 4 kept a bug report without requiring extensive detail.

However, note that the instruction itself is very brief and lacks substance. The prompt's criteria for keeping include 'significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion'. This sentence does not contain any of these elements; it is merely an imperative directive without context or details.

Therefore, while the AI correctly identified that elimination might be appropriate (as per its flawed reasoning), the evaluation itself should be incorrect because the primary conclusion ('to_eliminate': true) may not align with all cases. But wait: let's reexamine based on strict adherence to the prompt rules.

The original prompt says to eliminate content that is 'primarily composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts lacking a significant natural language narrative...'. The source text here is an instruction, which could be seen as communication intended for developers. However, it lacks any explanation or analysis - just a directive without substance.

Looking at the examples: Example 2 eliminated pure executable code; example 6 eliminated changelog entries that lacked detailed reasons. This content does not have explanatory narrative but is still an instruction meant for human readers (developers). The prompt's keep criteria include 'thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies'. Here, we don't know what the suggestion entails because there's no context provided in the source text.

But note: the AI must be strict. In this case, without any additional information about what 'llc does' means or providing details on how to set up the pipeline, it is primarily a technical artifact (an instruction) lacking significant natural language narrative. Therefore, according to the prompt's rules, it should likely be eliminated.

However, let me compare with example 5: that content was kept because it provided recommendations and explanations despite being in documentation format. This sentence does not provide any explanation or analysis - just an instruction without details.

So why did I initially say incorrect? Let's reevaluate the prompt rules:
- Keep if: significant natural language, explanation, commentary... OR reflects communication intended for developers (like thoughtful suggestions) even if embedded in technical artifacts.
- Eliminate if: primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts lacking a narrative.

The source text is an instruction. It could be seen as 'communication intended for developers' but it lacks the substance of explanation, analysis, etc. The prompt says to keep content that reflects such communication *if* it has significant natural language narrative. Here, there's no narrative - just one sentence with a command.

Therefore, according to the rules, this should be eliminated because it is lacking in explanatory elements and is primarily an artifact (an instruction). But wait: what if 'llc' refers to something specific? Without context, we cannot assume that. The AI must base its decision solely on the provided text.

The prompt's examples guide us: Example 3 kept a sentence with explanation; example 4 kept a bug report with analysis; example 5 kept documentation with recommendations. This instruction lacks any of these - no explanation, no analysis, just an order to set up like another tool does.

But note the keep criteria also includes 'even if embedded within technical artifacts'. However, this is not embedded in anything - it's a standalone sentence. It could be part of a larger document but we are only given this one line.

Given that there is no narrative or explanation provided beyond the instruction itself, and considering the examples where similar content was eliminated (like pure code lists), I think the AI should have kept it if it contained any meaningful communication. However, in example 2, a list of API functions was eliminated because it lacked human-written narrative.

This sentence is even less substantial than that - no explanation at all. It's just an instruction without context or details. Therefore, according to the prompt rules, it should be eliminated (to_eliminate: true).

But wait! The AI output says 'to_eliminate': True and provides reasoning for elimination. However, in example 5, content with similar structure was kept because it provided a recommendation and explanation of two strategies.

In this case, the sentence does not provide any such substance. It is simply an instruction without elaboration. Therefore, I believe the AI's evaluation should be correct: to_eliminate true.

However, let me check if there are any nuances in the prompt that might save it:
- The keep criteria says 'communication intended for developers or users' and includes thoughtful suggestions etc. This is a suggestion (to set up like llc does) but without thoughtfulness - just an instruction.
- Also, note that the examples kept content with more substance: Example 3 had performance trade-offs; example 4 had detailed bug analysis; example 5 had recommendations on strategies.

This sentence has none of these. It is a technical artifact (an instruction) lacking significant narrative or explanation. Therefore, it should be eliminated.

But why did I think incorrect earlier? Because the AI's reasoning was flawed in its justification for elimination. The prompt requires that we eliminate content primarily composed of non-prose artifacts without narrative. This output correctly eliminates but with a flawed reasoning: it says 'lacks substantive human-written prose and instead serves as a directive pointing to external technical artifacts'. However, this is not necessarily true - the sentence could be part of a larger context where llc's method was explained elsewhere.

But we are only given this one line. We cannot assume additional context that isn't present. Therefore, based on what is provided, it lacks narrative and explanation, so elimination is appropriate.

However, note: the original prompt says to keep content even if embedded in technical artifacts. This sentence doesn't seem to be embedding anything - it's just an instruction. But it could still fall under 'communication intended for developers' as a directive.

The key point from the examples is that we need significant natural language narrative or explanation. Here, there isn't any. So elimination seems correct.

But wait: in example 5, they kept content with tags and recommendations. This sentence has no tag but still an instruction. The difference is that example 5 provided a substantive discussion of the strategies, while this one does not. Therefore, it should be eliminated.

However, let's look at the exact wording of keep criteria: 'communication intended for developers or users' such as thoughtful suggestions... This sentence is a suggestion (to set up like llc) but without thoughtfulness - just copying another tool's method. It doesn't explain why, what are the trade-offs etc.

Therefore, I think it should be eliminated because it lacks detailed explanation and analysis. The AI correctly decided to eliminate with reasoning that aligns somewhat with the prompt rules (though not perfectly). But note: the examples show that even brief content can be kept if it has narrative or discussion.

In conclusion, based on strict adherence to the prompt's elimination criteria, this should be eliminated because it is lacking a significant natural language narrative. The AI output correctly reflects 'to_eliminate': true but with flawed reasoning (it doesn't need to point to external artifacts necessarily). However, since the evaluation task requires checking if all fields are present and correct according to the rules, I must judge whether this decision is justified.

The prompt's keep criteria require significant natural language narrative. This sentence does not have any - it's just an instruction without explanation or analysis. Therefore, elimination is appropriate. The AI output correctly eliminates but its reasoning could be improved (e.g., by citing the lack of narrative more directly). However, according to the evaluation criteria, if the main decision is correct then even flawed parts might allow for 'correct' verdict? No: let's read the criteria again.

Evaluation Criteria:
- `correct`: ALL fields in `<ai_output_to_verify>` are present, correct, and fully justified by the `<source_text>` according to the rules in the `<original_prompt>`. The reasoning must be accurate and relevant.
- `partially correct`: The main decision or classification is correct, BUT at least one part of the output is flawed. This includes weak, imprecise, irrelevant, or factually incorrect reasoning based on the `<source_text>`.

In this case, the AI's output has two fields:
1. `to_eliminate`: true (correct decision)
2. `reasoning`: ... which attempts to justify but is not fully accurate according to the prompt rules because it doesn't explicitly reference the lack of narrative or other criteria properly."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect. The <original_prompt> requires evaluating whether to filter out content based on specific criteria for human-written prose and technical discussion. However, the provided <source_text> contains a single sentence: 'If idle restore logs to main session window'. This appears to be a directive or instruction related to logging behavior in an application context.

The AI's reasoning field is completely irrelevant as it discusses dictionary comprehensions and input variables which are not mentioned in the source text. It also references unrelated concepts like being a teacher at a school, tables of integers, and examples that do not pertain to this content. This demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of both the prompt instructions and the source material.

Furthermore, the AI incorrectly states 'The user's query is not clear' when in fact the source text itself presents an unclear directive about logging behavior during idle state restoration. The output does not properly analyze or apply any rules from the original prompt to this content."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Content to evaluate:**
groups() on my gene expression data, I do get separate matrices for names, scores, pvals, and pvals_adj. However, the scores don't match the pvals. In other words, with decreasing pvals, we don't always have increasing score. I did check out the description on the main documentations page, and they say they're calculating the zscores underlying the distribution, however if that's the case shouldn't it always be higher with decreasing pval? Also, I went through the code: it looks like they're calculating the scores on the absolute values instead of the real values--why is this? Are the scores basically U1 values corresponding to the pvalues, in whcih case once again lower pvalues should always have higher scores right? ares calculated from the p-values? What's the relation between the two. I have ran sc.rank_genes_groups() on my gene expression data, and I have generated the matrix for cluster-1 versus the rest, for reference. You can see that one, the pavlues don't increase as we go down the rows; and two, the scores seem kinda arbitrary to the p-values. What am I missing here? Thanks a lot, and sorry for the wordy question. [NOTE: This doesn't just depend on a specific type of clustering technique. Irrespective of whether I try the in-built Leiden clustering technique, or the Schit library, or even cluster the cells randomly, this issue keeps occuring--which makes me think it's ether a bug, or I don't quite understand how the score generation works, maybe both. I've provided a little code snipper below.]. [ClusterOneVsRest.csv](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/files/12243486/ClusterOneVsRest.csv).

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The provided source text is a detailed human-written query about gene expression data analysis, specifically questioning discrepancies between scores and p-values in sc.rank_genes_groups() function from Scanpy library. It includes technical terms (like zscores, U1 values), code snippets for context, but the core substance is an explanation of confusion regarding programmatic artifacts (the user's own code snippet) and a discussion seeking clarification on how score generation works. This aligns with the criteria to keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users, including bug reports and detailed technical discussions embedded in natural language. The AI's reasoning fails to recognize this intent, instead focusing on irrelevant details like file references and code imports which are not the primary components of the text. Moreover, it incorrectly assumes that the presence of a code snippet makes the content primarily programmatic artifacts, but according to the prompt rules, even if embedded within technical artifacts, as long as there is significant natural language narrative or explanation, it should be kept."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated, but it fails to properly analyze and apply all rules from the original prompt. The source text contains a mix of natural language explanation and code blocks. While there is substantial prose discussing CMake features (e.g., caching mechanism, scripting language), the presence of embedded technical artifacts (code examples) must also be considered according to the prompt's instructions.

The AI correctly notes that the content includes human-written analysis but does not fully address whether this meets all criteria for keeping. The prompt requires evaluation based on: 1) significant natural language explanation, and 2) communication intended for developers or users about implementation strategies or trade-offs.
The source text does include substantial prose (e.g., ""CMake supports generating build files..."", ""This is useful because it allows the build system to skip long-running checks..."") that explains technical functionality. However, a large portion of the content consists of code blocks and documentation formatting which are considered technical artifacts under the prompt's elimination criteria.

The AI's reasoning does not adequately separate the evaluation into these components or provide sufficient justification for each part. It states there is ""substantial prose discussing CMake features"" but doesn't explicitly compare it to the required threshold (e.g., whether this qualifies despite having embedded code). Additionally, while mentioning examples are present, they are presented without any human analysis of them beyond their technical nature.

Therefore, the output should be considered partially correct because: 1) The classification is technically sound but incomplete in its application of all prompt rules; and 2) It does not sufficiently address whether the embedded code artifacts meet the criteria for elimination or keeping."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

e approach is to decrease the. clipping window from a given value to the value of one (DECREASING. CLIPPING WINDOW). Then the result obtained is given in the Figure 1.2. ![An alternative approach is to decrease the clipping window from a given value to the value of one (DECREASING CLIPPING WINDOW)](figures/image006.png). The estimated background is smoother. The method does not deform the. shape of peaks. However, sometimes the shape of the background is very complicated, and the. second order filter is insufficient. Let us illustrate such a case in. the Figure 1.3. The fourth order background estimation filter gives a better. estimate of complicated background (the clipping window `w=10`). ![The forth order background estimation filter gives better estimate of complicated background](figures/image008.png). 4-th order algorithm ignores linear as well as cubic component of the. background. In this case the filter is (1,-4,6,-4,1). In general, the. allowed values for the order of the filter are 2, 4, 6, 8. An example of. the same spectrum estimated with the clipping window `w=40` and with. filters of the orders 2, 4, 6, 8 is given in the Figure 1.4. ![The same spectrum estimated with the clipping window `w=40` and with filters of the orders 2, 4, 6, 8](figures/image010.png). Sometimes it is necessary to also include the Compton edges. into the estimate of the background. In Figure 1.5 we present the example of. the synthetic spectrum with Compton edges. The background was estimated. using the 8-th order filter with the estimation of the Compton edges and. decreasing clipping window. In the lower part of the Figure we present. the background, which was added to the synthetic spectrum. One can. observe good coincidence with the estimated background. The method of. the estimation of Compton edge is described in details in [3]. ![Synthetic spectrum with Compton edges](figures/image012.png). The generalized form of the algorithm is implemented in the following function. ``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

While it contains some natural language elements (like 'ignoring nonexistent directory'), the majority of the text is technical artifacts such as file paths, permissions, compiler commands, and system configurations.

The source text is a detailed log of compiler flags and system configurations, but it does contain some natural language elements (e.g., 'ignoring nonexistent directory'). However, according to the prompt's rules, this should not necessarily be filtered out if there is any human-written explanation or analysis embedded within technical artifacts. In fact, the reasoning provided by the AI fails to recognize that parts of the text like 'Apple clang version 16.0.0' and other comments might contain valuable information about system setup or compiler behavior for developers. The prompt explicitly states that even if content is formatted as technical artifacts, it should be kept if there's significant natural language explanation. Here, while most parts are indeed technical, the presence of any explanatory text (like 'ignoring nonexistent directory') means this falls under the keep category."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The source text contains multiple test failures with error messages (AssertionError and NotImplementedError) that are technical artifacts. However, these errors might include human analysis if they were part of a discussion or report. But in this case, it is just raw logs without any narrative explanation. Looking at the examples provided: Example 1 eliminates build logs because they lack human analysis; similarly here, there's no indication of human-written prose. The content includes specific test names and failure reasons (e.g., 'Image files did not match' or 'Failed in nopython mode pipeline'), which could be part of a technical discussion if framed properly, but without any surrounding context like an explanation, it is purely diagnostic logs.

7037,"ns. Under this assumption, younger loads are always allowed to pass older stores (this would only affects rule 4). Essentially, this class doesn't perform any sort alias analysis to identify aliasing loads and stores. To enforce aliasing between loads and stores, flag `AssumeNoAlias` must be set to `false` by the constructor of LSUnit. Note that this class doesn't know about the existence of different memory types for memory operations (example: write-through, write-combining, etc.). Derived classes are responsible for implementing that extra knowledge, and provide different sets of rules for loads and stores by overriding method `isReady()`. To emulate a write-combining memory type, rule 2. must be relaxed in a derived class to enable the reordering of non-aliasing store operations. No assumptions are made by this class on the size of the store buffer. This class doesn't know how to identify cases where store-to-load forwarding may occur. LSUnit doesn't attempt to predict whether a load or store hits or misses the L1 cache. To be more specific, LSUnit doesn't know anything about cache hierarchy and memory types. It only knows if an instruction mayLoad and/or mayStore"". For loads, the scheduling model provides an optimistic load-to-use latency (which usually matches the load-to-use latency for when there is a hit in the L1D). Derived classes may expand this knowledge. Class MCInstrDesc in LLVM doesn't know about serializing operations, nor memory-barrier like instructions. LSUnit conservatively assumes that an instruction which `mayLoad` and has `unmodeled side effects` behave like a soft load-barrier. That means, it serializes loads without forcing a flush of the load queue. Similarly, instructions that both `mayStore` and have `unmodeled side effects` are treated like store barriers. A full memory barrier is a mayLoad and mayStore instruction with unmodeled side effects. This is obviously inaccurate, but this is the best that we can do at the moment. Ea","

ns. Under this assumption, younger loads are always allowed to pass older stores (this would only affects rule 4). Essentially, this class doesn't perform any sort alias analysis to identify aliasing loads and stores. To enforce aliasing between loads and stores, flag `AssumeNoAlias` must be set to `false` by the constructor of LSUnit. Note that this class doesn't know about the existence of different memory types for memory operations (example: write-through, write-combining, etc.). Derived classes are responsible for implementing that extra knowledge, and provide different sets of rules for loads and stores by overriding method `isReady()`. To emulate a write-combining memory type, rule 2. must be relaxed in a derived class to enable the reordering of non-aliasing store operations. No assumptions are made by this class on the size of the store buffer. This class doesn't know how to identify cases where store-to-load forwarding may occur. LSUnit doesn't attempt to predict whether a load or store hits or misses the L1 cache. To be more specific, LSUnit doesn't know anything about cache hierarchy and memory types. It only knows if an instruction mayLoad and/or mayStore"".

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should be eliminated (to_eliminate: True) based on the prompt's rules, as it is a list of file paths and source code files without any natural language narrative or explanation. However, the reasoning provided by the AI does not fully align with the evaluation criteria because while the content lacks human-written analysis, it also includes multiple technical artifacts that could potentially contain valuable discussions if they were prose. The prompt explicitly states to keep scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions even when embedded in technical artifacts, but this specific list is purely a collection of file names and paths without any accompanying discussion or commentary. Therefore, the AI's reasoning correctly notes the absence of narrative but fails to fully justify why it meets the elimination criteria by not considering all aspects of the prompt."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should be eliminated, but its reasoning contains inaccuracies. The source text is a list of technical issues with C++23 standard specifications (e.g., 'C++23', 'DR.', 'review', etc.). According to the prompt rules, we must keep content if it has significant natural language narrative or explanation. However, this output fails to recognize that some entries might contain discussion elements. For instance, 'drafting' and 'tentatively ready' statuses could imply ongoing human analysis (e.g., 2623 is marked as drafting, which suggests active consideration). The AI's reasoning states it lacks meaningful prose, but the prompt allows keeping content even if embedded in technical artifacts.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the provided source text as being to be eliminated. The original prompt requires evaluating whether the given target content should be filtered out, specifically by identifying if it contains meaningful human-written prose or technical discussion intended for developers/users.

In this case, the source text is a header file comment that includes license information and describes a tool's functionality along with some example statistics. According to the original prompt:
- The content must be kept if it consists of significant natural language explanation, analysis, or discussion.
- It should not be eliminated merely because it contains technical artifacts; what matters is the substance and intent being human-written.

The AI incorrectly identifies this as a changelog without any narrative. However, upon examining the source text:
1. The header file comment includes natural language explaining the tool's purpose: ""This view collects and prints register file usage statistics"".
2. It provides example data with analysis of technical metrics (total mappings created/used, optimizable moves eliminated).
3. This matches Example 5 from the prompt where content embedded in tags is kept if it has human-written explanation.

Therefore, the AI's classification as `to_eliminate: true` is wrong because this source text does contain meaningful natural language and technical discussion intended for developers (e.g., about register file usage statistics). The correct evaluation should be to keep this content (`to_eliminate: false`)."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)

",partially correct,"The `to_eliminate` field in the AI output is set to true, which aligns with the prompt's instructions. However, the reasoning provided by the AI does not fully justify this decision based on the source text and rules from the original prompt. The content 'Try to merge vector loads and extend_inreg to an extload' should be evaluated according to the criteria in the original prompt.

According to the Keep Content That section of the original prompt, we should keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users, such as thoughtful suggestions or explanations of implementation strategies. The AI's reasoning states that it lacks sufficient natural language explanation and is too brief, but this does not consider if the content itself contains any meaningful human-written prose.

Looking at the source text: 'Try to merge vector loads and extend_inreg to an extload.' This appears to be a technical instruction without substantial narrative or analysis. However, it could still be kept if it is part of a larger discussion or provides insight for developers. The prompt's criteria emphasize that even embedded technical artifacts should be kept if they contain significant natural language.

The AI correctly identifies the lack of detailed explanation but fails to note that this instruction might be intended as a comment within code development, which could still qualify for keeping under certain conditions (e.g., it is part of a commit message or collaborative discussion). The prompt does not require the content to have an explanatory narrative if it is embedded in technical artifacts; rather, it focuses on the substance and intent. Since this instruction lacks any natural language narrative beyond its brevity, it should be eliminated.

The AI's reasoning correctly points out that there is no substantial prose but could improve by explicitly referencing the prompt's rules about keeping content with significant natural language or explanation. However, because the primary decision (to_eliminate: true) appears correct based on the lack of narrative in the source text, and the reasoning attempts to justify it though it may not be exhaustive, I would classify this as partially correct."

The provided source text describes a change in code configuration regarding parallel processing in UMAP integration with Scanpy. It contains significant natural language discussing trade-offs (allowing control of parallel vs not merging until specific version), which is explicitly mentioned as content to keep even if embedded within technical artifacts. The reasoning given by the AI fails to recognize this substance, instead focusing on irrelevant aspects like 'version control metadata' and misinterpreting the context."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.

The AI's reasoning fails to recognize that these warnings provide valuable insight into technical challenges during development, such as data loss risks in specific conversions (size_t to const similarity::IdTypeUnsign). They are part of the diagnostic process but contain substantial natural language analysis about code behavior. Therefore, the classification should be 'false' for elimination."
4839,Align must be a power of 2.,"
You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it does not properly analyze the source text according to the original prompt. The <original_prompt> requires evaluating whether the given content should be filtered out based on specific criteria for keeping or eliminating technical artifacts with human-written prose. However, the provided <ai_output_to_verify> contains a flawed reasoning field that references an unrelated user query about a Python function and input string s = 12345-08-09T16:07:28. This is completely irrelevant to the task at hand, which involves analyzing the source text about certificate loading failures from CURLOPT_CAPATH.

The AI's reasoning incorrectly assumes that it needs to consider an unrelated user query for this evaluation. The correct approach would be to focus solely on the content provided in <source_text> and apply the filtering rules as specified in the prompt. In this case, the source text consists of multiple lines describing failed certificate loads from various paths using CURLOPT_CAPATH.

According to the elimination criteria, this content is primarily composed of non-prose technical artifacts (specifically log entries or error messages) that lack significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion. Each line starts with 'failed to load' and lists a file path along with the source ('from CURLOPT_CAPATH'). There are no human-written explanations, analyses, or discussions about these failures; it is simply a list of technical artifacts without any surrounding context or commentary.

Therefore, the correct evaluation should be that this content should be eliminated (to_eliminate: true). The AI's output incorrectly states to_eliminate as false and provides reasoning based on an unrelated topic."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.

 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the source text as being eliminated. The original prompt requires evaluating whether content should be filtered out based on its substance and intent for human readers, even if embedded in technical artifacts.

First, analyze the goal: The task is to identify and keep content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers. Content with significant natural language narrative, commentary, or discussion should be kept, regardless of being part of a technical artifact.

Analyze the source text:
The provided source text includes license information (Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions) and a statement about what the file defines (""This file defined the Environment and EnvironmentManager classes""). This is not purely code or formal specifications; it contains natural language that explains the purpose of the file.

Scrutinize the AI's output:
The `to_eliminate` field in the output is set to true, meaning the content should be eliminated. However, according to the prompt rules, this type of text (which includes a narrative about what the file does) should not necessarily be eliminated if it contains significant natural language and explanation.

The AI's reasoning states that the content ""appears to be a standard header or footer from an environment configuration,"" but in reality, it is part of a license block. The prompt explicitly says to keep content even if embedded within technical artifacts, as long as there is meaningful human-written prose. In this case, the text does contain natural language narrative (""This file defined..."") and references to licenses which are standard for open-source projects but still constitute explanation or commentary intended for developers/users.

Therefore, the AI's classification of `to_eliminate: true` is incorrect because it fails to recognize that the source text includes a narrative about the file's purpose. The correct evaluation should be false (i.e., not eliminate) since there is human-written content explaining what the file does."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content. The original prompt requires evaluating whether to filter out (eliminate) or keep content based on its being human-written prose with explanation, analysis, etc., primarily technical artifacts lacking significant natural language narrative should be eliminated.

In this case, the source text is a technical instruction about register saving in assembly: 'Do not explicitly save the callee saved VSRp registers. The individual VSR subregisters will be saved instead.' This content falls under scientific or detailed technical discussions (as per Keep criteria) because it explains a specific strategy for handling registers and discusses trade-offs by implying that explicit saving is avoided, which might relate to performance optimization.

The AI's reasoning states the content lacks natural language narrative, but this text does contain significant technical explanation. It describes what should not be done ('do not explicitly save') and specifies an alternative approach ('save individual VSR subregisters'). This aligns with the Keep criteria for including scientific or academic discussions even if embedded in technical artifacts.

Therefore, according to the prompt's rules, this content should NOT be eliminated (to_eliminate: false). The AI incorrectly set it as true."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies the content as not to be eliminated (`to_eliminate`: false) and provides a detailed explanation of why. However, there are several issues with the reasoning that make it partially flawed:

1. The prompt requires evaluating if the target content should be filtered out (eliminated). The correct classification is whether it contains meaningful human-written prose or not.
2. In its output, the AI states `to_eliminate`: false meaning keep the content, which aligns with the examples provided in the prompt where technical discussions are kept even when embedded in artifacts.

The reasoning mentions that the text includes code examples and detailed analysis of trade-offs. This is accurate as per the source text:
- It does contain C++ code snippets (e.g., `void someFunc1() {...}`).
- It provides recommendations on API design, discussing pros and cons of using different types.

However, there are flaws in how it justifies keeping the content:

The prompt's criteria for keeping content is that it should be ""meaningful human-written prose, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion"" intended for developers. The AI correctly notes that this includes technical artifacts with embedded narrative.

But the reasoning fails to properly analyze and compare against the elimination criteria from the prompt:
- It does not explicitly check if the content lacks significant natural language narrative (which it doesn't).
- More importantly, while the text has some prose elements, a large portion is composed of technical artifacts: formal C++ code snippets, API signatures, and references to specific implementations. The source text includes many lines that are purely technical without substantial explanation.

Specifically, the content contains:
- Multiple code blocks (e.g., `void someFunc1() {...}`).
- Formal definitions like ""SmallVectorImpl is widely used"" which lacks depth or analysis.
- A reference to a specific header file and its utility.

The AI's reasoning does not adequately address these points. It focuses on the positive aspects but overlooks that much of the content is purely technical artifacts without substantial human narrative, explanation, or discussion about them. The text describes what SmallVectorImpl does but doesn't provide meaningful analysis or commentary beyond stating facts and recommendations.

Therefore, while the primary conclusion (`to_eliminate`: false) might be correct in spirit (keeping technical discussions), the reasoning is insufficiently detailed and fails to properly ground its decision by thoroughly examining all parts of the source text against the prompt's elimination criteria. The output does not fully justify why this content should not be eliminated based on a comprehensive analysis, making it partially flawed."

It will now be show that among the family of all the complete orthonormal bases of the pattern space, the base formed by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and belonging to the largest eigenvalues, corresponds to the most significant features of the description of the original prototypes. let the prototypes be expanded on into a set of \f$N\f$ basis vectors \f$\mathbf{e}_n, n=0,\ldots,N,N+1, \ldots, P-1\f$ \f[ \mathbf{y}_i = \sum^N_{i=0} a_{i_n} \mathbf{e}_n, \quad i = 1, \ldots, M, \quad N &lt; P-1 \f] The `best feature coordinates \f$\mathbf{e}_n\f$, spanning a *feature space*, will be obtained by minimizing the error due to this truncated expansion, i.e., \f[ \min\left(E_N\right) = \min\left[\left\langle\left(\mathbf{y}_i - \sum^N_{i=0} a_{i_n} \mathbf{e}_n\right)^2\right\rangle\right] \f] with the conditions: \f[ \mathbf{e}_k\bullet\mathbf{e}_j = \delta_{jk} = \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 1 &amp; \mbox{for} &amp; k = j\\ 0 &amp; \mbox{for} &amp; k \neq j \end{array}\right. \f] Multiplying (3) by \f$\mathbf{e}^T_n\f$ using (5), we get \f[ a_{i_n} = \mathbf{y}_i^T\bullet\mathbf{e}_n\,, \f] so the error becomes \f{eqnarray*}{ E_N &amp;=&amp; \left\langle\left[\sum_{n=N+1}^{P-1} a_{i_n}\mathbf{e}_n\right]^2\right\rangle\nonumber\\ &amp;=&amp; \left\langle\left[\s

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
. alignments in IGV. See the What is the realigner and how does it work? section. for instructions. **Missing variants where a candidate is generated:**. If a candidate is made, but is called as reference (either 0/0 or ./.) it means. that the neural network processed the genomic region, but based on all of its. learned experience from training data, it decided the highest probability for. the position was as non-variant. Some of the reasons that DeepVariant may. suspect a false positive are: strand-bias in reads, low mapping quality in. reads, low base quality in reads, and overall low coverage. In addition, there is another pattern that causes DeepVariant to suspect variant. positions which can initially seem counterintuitive to human observers. This. occurs when a dense set of variants appears on one haplotype while the other. haplotype is fully reference, and humans often perceive this as missing a. clearly heterozygous position. DeepVariant seems to have learned that this. signature often indicates a region which is a segmental duplication, copy number. variant, or structural variant where multiple copies of similar genomic regions. are mapping to the same reference location. In this case, it may be worthwhile. to inspect the region to see if it has elevated coverage, and whether you can. identify more than 2 haplotypes present by overlapping the reads. If you can, it. suggests that the region may have a copy number variation. Some analysis of this. was presented at AGBT as a poster. “[Uncaptured segmental duplication creates artifacts in workflows using GRCh37](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERe2bSyWsAcE00h?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)”.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated (`to_eliminate` is false). However, it fails to properly analyze the source text according to the prompt rules. The original prompt requires evaluating whether the given target content should be filtered out based on specific criteria for keeping or eliminating content.

In this case, the provided `source_text` contains a mathematical formula and technical details about an implementation (Cephes from S. Moshier) along with conditions for correctness. According to the keep criteria in the prompt:
- It includes scientific/academic/detailed technical discussions (the definition of the function is highly formal).
- The substance should be kept even if embedded within technical artifacts.

The AI's reasoning correctly notes that there is natural language explanation and references, but it does not fully address all aspects required by the prompt. Specifically:
1. It mentions ""analysis"", which aligns with keeping content.
2. However, upon closer inspection of the source text, we see that it describes a technical implementation (Cephes) and conditions for correctness without any substantial human-written narrative or discussion beyond stating facts. The text is primarily composed of non-prose programmatic artifacts: mathematical formulas, function definitions, parameter constraints, and references to external libraries.

The prompt's keep criteria emphasize content with ""significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion"" intended for developers/users. While the output includes some natural language elements (e.g., ""This is correct only if..."", ""For a>0 and x<0 0 is returned...""), it lacks deeper analysis or communication that would make it human-written in intent.

Moreover, note that the prompt's eliminate criteria include content lacking significant natural language narrative. The source text does contain some prose but not enough to be considered meaningful for human readers without being a technical artifact itself. It describes what the function is and how it behaves technically, which falls under the keep category if there were explanatory elements.

But crucially, the AI's output reasoning does not explicitly compare against all elimination criteria or provide a complete justification based on the source text's content. For instance:
- The prompt requires that kept content has ""significant natural language"" and reflects communication intended for developers/users. This content is technical documentation but lacks any unique insight or analysis beyond stating facts.

Therefore, while `to_eliminate` being false might be acceptable (since it meets some keep criteria), the reasoning provided by the AI does not fully justify this verdict according to all prompt rules."

to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
AddDelta - When a change is made that shifts around the text buffer, this method is used to record that info. It inserts a delta of Delta into the current DeltaTree at offset FileIndex.

    </original_prompt>
    
    <ai_output_to_verify>
        <to_eliminate>True</to_eliminate>
    <reasoning>This appears to be a technical artifact describing a function's purpose and parameters without providing any meaningful human-written prose or analysis. The content is purely explanatory in nature but lacks depth, context, or discussion intended for human readers. It describes the functionality of 'AddDelta' method but does not offer insights, critiques, or detailed explanations that would make it valuable for developers or users.</reasoning>
    </ai_output_to_verify>
</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated. The provided source text describes a technical method called 'AddDelta' that is used for recording changes in a text buffer, specifically inserting a delta into a DeltaTree at an offset FileIndex. This description includes technical details and parameters (delta of Delta, current DeltaTree, offset FileIndex) which are characteristic of programmatic artifacts. However, according to the original prompt's rules, content should be kept if it reflects communication intended for developers or users, such as explanations of implementation strategies or trade-offs. The source text does contain a narrative explaining what the method does and its parameters, but it is not explicitly discussing trade-offs or providing deeper analysis. It is primarily technical in nature, describing an API function without additional commentary. Based on the evaluation criteria, this content should be considered for elimination because it lacks significant natural language explanation or discussion beyond stating the basic functionality. The AI's reasoning incorrectly states that there is no meaningful human-written prose or analysis present, but actually the source text does contain a narrative about the method's purpose and parameters. However, since the classification 'to_eliminate' is true in this case (as it lacks substantial discussion), the main decision of eliminating the content should be correct according to the prompt. But wait, let me re-examine: The original prompt says to keep content that includes scientific, academic or detailed technical discussions even if highly formal. This source text does not appear to have a deep technical discussion; it is just stating what the method does in a very brief manner. It lacks explanatory comments about why this method exists, its design choices, trade-offs etc., which are required for keeping content that reflects communication intended for developers or users. Therefore, according to the prompt's rules, this should be eliminated because it lacks significant natural language narrative beyond basic description of functionality. The AI correctly identified 'to_eliminate' as true but provided flawed reasoning by saying ""lacks any meaningful human-written prose or analysis"" when in fact there is some technical explanation present, but not enough for keeping according to the prompt's criteria."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the content as to be eliminated (to_eliminate: true). According to the original prompt, we should keep content that reflects communication intended for developers or users and includes scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions. The provided source text is a commit message from a version control system where the author explains their intention to close a draft due to pending merge routines but mentions potential future usefulness of discussions in related PRs. This contains significant natural language narrative (e.g., 'I'm going to close this draft', 'we shouldn't merge yet', 'discussions may be useful for future reference') and technical analysis regarding the state of development, which aligns with the criteria for keeping content even if embedded within technical artifacts. The AI's reasoning is flawed because it misidentifies the source text as a changelog without commentary on reasons, whereas in fact, it includes human-written explanation about closing drafts and referencing discussions, making it eligible to be kept."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

According to the original prompt, we should keep content that includes significant natural language explanation or analysis. The provided source text is a detailed discussion about statistical tests and their relevance to scRNAseq data, with multiple references but also substantial commentary from the author's perspective. It contains human-written prose discussing trade-offs between t-tests and rank-sum tests, citing sources, and explaining why one might be preferred over the other in specific contexts (like scRNAseq). The AI's reasoning is flawed because it focuses on the presence of links without considering that the text itself has a narrative structure with analysis. For instance, the author explicitly states their intuitive preference for rank-sum tests due to distributional violations affecting t-tests, and discusses diffxpy's approach in handling noise models.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**

These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly eliminates the content when it should be kept. According to the original prompt, we must keep scientific or detailed technical discussions even if they are embedded in code comments. The source text contains multiple lines of what appear to be C++ code comments (indicated by `//`), each printing a matrix with different names and arguments. These comments might serve as part of debugging or logging information within the codebase, but without any narrative explaining why these prints are happening or their significance in human terms, they fall under the category that should be eliminated only if lacking significant natural language narrative. However, note that the prompt allows keeping content even if it is formatted as technical artifacts, provided there's a substantial explanation. In this case, each line is just an instruction to print something without any accompanying analysis or discussion. The AI correctly identified that these are code comments but failed to recognize that they lack human-written narrative and thus should be eliminated only if not providing unique insight. But wait, the prompt says: 'Crucially: This content should be kept even if it is embedded within or formatted as technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the substance and intent of the natural language text.' However, in this output, there's no natural language narrative at all. Each line is a comment that says 'PrintMatrix(something)' but doesn't explain it. Therefore, according to the rules, since there's no significant natural language explanation or discussion, these should be eliminated. But let me re-read: The prompt states we keep content with significant natural language, etc., and even if embedded in technical artifacts. In this case, the entire source text is composed of comments that are purely technical instructions (to print matrices) without any prose explaining them. So they lack a narrative or explanation for human readers. However, note that some lines might be part of a larger context where these prints are meaningful, but here we only have isolated comments. The AI's reasoning correctly states there is no narrative beyond referencing what would typically be printed. But the classification 'to_eliminate: True' seems correct based on the absence of substantial natural language text. However, I must check if any line contains a narrative or explanation. Looking at each comment: `//PrintMatrix(df[i],'df[i]');` — this is just an instruction to print, no explanation. Similarly for others. None provide analysis or discussion. Therefore, according to the prompt's rules, they should be eliminated because there is no significant natural language narrative. But wait, let me compare with Example 5: In Example 5, content like `@name Mutation APIs` and then an explanation was kept. Here, we have comments that are just instructions without any explanatory text. So yes, the AI's decision to eliminate seems correct. However, I notice a discrepancy in my own thought process above — initially I said incorrect but now after re-evaluating, it should be 'correct'. Let me clarify: The prompt requires keeping content with significant natural language narrative or explanation. This source text has no such thing; it is purely technical artifacts (code comments) without explanatory prose. Therefore, the AI's output correctly classifies this as to_eliminate: true."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

However, according to the original prompt, we should keep content that includes significant natural language explanation or discussion. The provided source text is a long list of failed module loads, which can be seen as an error log snippet. While it lacks explicit human analysis in this instance, it still contains a narrative about system failures and could potentially reflect communication intended for developers (e.g., to debug the issue). Moreover, the prompt explicitly states that even if embedded within technical artifacts, content with substance should be kept. The AI's reasoning is too broad in its elimination criteria; it fails to recognize that this list might serve as a basis for human discussion or analysis about why certain modules failed and what steps are needed.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly states `to_eliminate` as True. According to the original prompt, content should be eliminated only if it is primarily composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts lacking significant natural language narrative. The provided source text contains detailed explanation about dataflow analysis for debug values in machine code, including VarLocMap and lattice values. It includes scientific/academic discussion on implementation strategies (e.g., handling loops by assuming live-through) and technical details with commentary. This meets the criteria to keep content as per Example 5 where tagged documentation still qualifies if it provides detailed explanation of design trade-offs. The AI's reasoning fails because: 1) It misjudges that formal terms automatically mean elimination, but the prompt emphasizes substance over formality; 2) It overlooks the embedded natural language narrative discussing accuracy and handling loops (which is explicitly allowed). Therefore, `to_eliminate` should be false."

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Content to evaluate:**
[ROOT-9733] TRandom3 does not implement perfectly a Mersenne Twister PRNG; Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. Description. From https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9733. The {{TRandom3}} is a random number engine based on Mersenne Twister algorithm, defined in {{TRandom3.cxx}}. Since 2002 (see [commit 026ec9c0f458be61825e7335ec51e115ec6cbf4c](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/026ec9c0f458be61825e7335ec51e115ec6cbf4c)), an eventual zero return value is discarded by {{TRandom3::Rndm()}}. This does not allow the algorithm to return the same sequence of the C++11 standard implementation {{std::mt19937}} (when seeded with the same value - except for seed zero, since handled in a special way by {{TRandom3::SetSeed()}} - and multiplied by 2^-32). A related mistake is present also in the description of the class, where it states the algorithm period to be 2^19937 - 1. If you discard the zeros, of course the period will be (very slightly) less than it. In conclusion, {{TRandom3}} is an imperfect implementation of the Mersenne Twister 32-bit algoritm. Furthermore, the documentation does not explain this small difference.  . Reproducer. As per the description. ROOT version. Any. Installation method. Any. Operating system. Any.

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies that the content should not be eliminated (to_eliminate: false) because it discusses implementation trade-offs. However, the reasoning provided is flawed in several ways:

1. The prompt requires evaluating whether to keep or eliminate based on meaningful human-written prose and technical discussion for developers.
2. While the output mentions a recommendation about linker behavior, this specific part ('Leave it to the linker') does not contain substantial natural language narrative explaining trade-offs; instead, it describes an action without elaboration.
3. The example given in the source text (e.g., printf => puts) is technical but lacks detailed explanation of why dead_strip might be better or worse than other methods.
4. The AI's reasoning incorrectly assumes that all content discussing technical artifacts should be kept, whereas the prompt specifies keeping only if it contains significant natural language narrative and discussion. This output does not fully meet those criteria as it primarily describes a procedure without deep analysis."
