The number of division (`ndiv`) is a composite integer given by: ` ndiv = N1 + 100*N2 + 10000*N3` `N1` = number of 1st divisions. `N2` = number of 2nd divisions. `N3` = number of 3rd divisions. by default the value of `N1`, `N2` and `N3` are maximum values. After optimisation the real number of divisions will be smaller or equal to these value. If one wants to bypass the optimisation, the option `""N""` should be given when the `TGaxis` is created. The option `""I""` also act on the number of division as it will force an integer labelling of the axis. On an histogram pointer `h` the number of divisions can be set in different ways:. Directly on the histogram. The following will set the number of division to 510 on the X axis of `h`.

The number of division (`ndiv`) is a composite integer given by: ` ndiv = N1 + 100*N2 + 10000*N3` `N1` = number of 1st divisions. `N2` = number of 2nd divisions. `N3` = number of 3rd divisions. by default the value of `N1`, `N2` and `N3` are maximum values. After optimisation the real number of divisions will be smaller or equal to these value. If one wants to bypass the optimisation, the option `""N""` should be given when the `TGaxis` is created. The option `""I""` also act on the number of division as it will force an integer labelling of the axis. On an histogram pointer `h` the number of divisions can be set in different ways:.

Apart from `.l` for local variables, it would be nice if ROOT (or cling) had a graphical way of displaying variables with its value, potentially as a TreeView'. Something like:. `new TVariableBrowser()`. instead of. `new TBrowser()`. Or maybe, it could be just a new TGTab inside the already existing TBrowser. If the variable is an std::vector, one could maybe right click on it and click on Scan or Print as if were a TTree. Or double-clicking on it could unfold the tree view, or open a new GUI dialog with the vector. Something like:. https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/variableexplorer.html. Describe alternatives you've considered. I use the QtCreator's debugger to see the list of variables, see https://root.cern/blog/code-horsepower-f1/#debugging-your-root-scripts-or-executables-with-gdb, but it would be nice to have this available directly from the TBrowser or from the terminal. One could also use Python and Spyder, but that's not directly the ROOT terminal... Additional context. If the feature were helpful for cling users, it should not rely on ROOT, maybe just a python script behind the scenes using Tkinter as GUI, that can be run from the cling terminal?""

Moreover, modules can specify which languages they work with, so, e.g., one can not accidentally attempt to load a C++ module into a C program. Problems modules do not solve. -----------------------------. Many programming languages have a module or package system, and because of the variety of features provided by these languages it is important to define what modules do *not* do. In particular, all of the following are considered out-of-scope for modules:. * **Rewrite the world's code**: It is not realistic to require applications or software libraries to make drastic or non-backward-compatible changes, nor is it feasible to completely eliminate headers. Modules must interoperate with existing software libraries and allow a gradual transition. * **Versioning**: Modules have no notion of version information.

""s can only be built standalone, tools can rely on the module definition to ensure that they get the complete API for the library. Moreover, modules can specify which languages they work with, so, e.g., one can not accidentally attempt to load a C++ module into a C program. Problems modules do not solve. -----------------------------. Many programming languages have a module or package system, and because of the variety of features provided by these languages it is important to define what modules do *not* do. In particular, all of the following are considered out-of-scope for modules:. * **Rewrite the world's code**: It is not realistic to require applications or software libraries to make drastic or non-backward-compatible changes, nor is it feasible to completely eliminate headers. Modules must interoperate with existing software libraries and allow a gradual transition. * **Versioning**: Modules have no notion of version information. Programmers must still rely on the existing versioning mechanisms of the underlying language (if any exist) to version software libraries. * **Namespaces**: Unlike in some languages, modules do not imply any notion of namespaces.

Compile a Macro with the Compiler. A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and. commercial. We will refer to the `GCC` compiler in the following. In. this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and. then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all. the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it. prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with. the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an. entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the. procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into. a stand-alone application is to add the following dressing code at the. end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose. of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}. int main() {. ExampleMacro();. return 0;. }. ```. To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type. ``` {.cpp}. > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --libs`. `""

Instead, modules automatically translate ``#include`` directives into the corresponding module import. For example, the include directive. .. code-block:: c. include <stdio.h>. will be automatically mapped to an import of the module ``std.io``. Even with specific ``import`` syntax in the language, this particular feature is important for both adoption and backward compatibility: automatic translation of ``#include`` to ``import`` allows an application to get the benefits of modules (for all modules-enabled libraries) without any changes to the application itself. Thus, users can easily use modules with one compiler while falling back to the preprocessor-inclusion mechanism with other compilers. .. note::. The automatic mapping of ``#include`` to ``import`` also solves an implementation problem: importing a module with a definition of some entity (say, a ``struct Point``) and then parsing a header containing another definition of ``struct Point`` would cause a redefinition error, even if it is the same ``struct Point``. By mapping ``#include`` to ``import``, the compiler can guarantee that it always sees just the already-parsed definition from the module. While building a module, ``#include_next`` is also supported, with one caveat. The usual behavior of ``#include_next`` is to search for the specified filename. in the list of include paths, starting from the path *after* the one. in which the current file was found. Because files listed in module maps are not found through include paths, a. different strategy is used for ``#include_next`` directives in such files: the. list of include paths is searched for the specified header name, to find the. first include path that would refer to the current file. ``#include_next`` is. interpreted as if the current file had been found in that path.

Even with specific ``import`` syntax in the language, this particular feature is important for both adoption and backward compatibility: automatic translation of ``#include`` to ``import`` allows an application to get the benefits of modules (for all modules-enabled libraries) without any changes to the application itself. Thus, users can easily use modules with one compiler while falling back to the preprocessor-inclusion mechanism with other compilers. .. note::. The automatic mapping of ``#include`` to ``import`` also solves an implementation problem: importing a module with a definition of some entity (say, a ``struct Point``) and then parsing a header containing another definition of ``struct Point`` would cause a redefinition error, even if it is the same ``struct Point``. By mapping ``#include`` to ``import``, the compiler can guarantee that it always sees just the already-parsed definition from the module. While building a module, ``#include_next`` is also supported, with one caveat. The usual behavior of ``#include_next`` is to search for the specified filename. in the list of include paths, starting from the path *after* the one. in which the current file was found. Because files listed in module maps are not found through include paths, a. different strategy is used for ``#include_next`` directives in such files: the. list of include paths is searched for the specified header name, to find the. first include path that would refer to the current file. ``#include_next`` is. interpreted as if the current file had been found in that path.
