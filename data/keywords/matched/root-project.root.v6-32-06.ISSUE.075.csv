Make changes in the class AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim. ## Changes or fixes:. Delete obscure conditions on evaluating integration status. The mentioned conditions are absent in the original RadMul algorithm. The problem with these conditions is in that they compare some arbitrary hard-coded constants with the absolute value of the integrated function. This lead to incorrect integration of some complicated function. Moreover, if one multiply integrand by some arbitrary factor and then divide the integral by it, then time and accuracy integration will change, but it shouldn't be so. For example, if integrated function return result of order 10^-38, then sometimes integration gives nonsense result with very low number of integrated function calls. The parameter RelAccuracy is not accounted for by the algorithm in this case (return result with some lower accuracy). But if the return value of integrated function multiply by 10^38 and then multiply the result of integration by 10^-38 then the integration gives the correct result with appropriate number of integrand calls. The parameter RelAccuracy then does work in this case.

Make changes in the class AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim. ## Changes or fixes:. Delete obscure conditions on evaluating integration status. The mentioned conditions are absent in the original RadMul algorithm. The problem with these conditions is in that they compare some arbitrary hard-coded constants with the absolute value of the integrated function. This lead to incorrect integration of some complicated function. Moreover, if one multiply integrand by some arbitrary factor and then divide the integral by it, then time and accuracy integration will change, but it shouldn't be so. For example, if integrated function return result of order 10^-38, then sometimes integration gives nonsense result with very low number of integrated function calls. The parameter RelAccuracy is not accounted for by the algorithm in this case (return result with some lower accuracy). But if the return value of integrated function multiply by 10^38 and then multiply the result of integration by 10^-38 then the integration gives the correct result with appropriate number of integrand calls. The parameter RelAccuracy then does work in this case.

Make changes in the class AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim. ## Changes or fixes:. Delete obscure conditions on evaluating integration status. The mentioned conditions are absent in the original RadMul algorithm. The problem with these conditions is in that they compare some arbitrary hard-coded constants with the absolute value of the integrated function. This lead to incorrect integration of some complicated function. Moreover, if one multiply integrand by some arbitrary factor and then divide the integral by it, then time and accuracy integration will change, but it shouldn't be so. For example, if integrated function return result of order 10^-38, then sometimes integration gives nonsense result with very low number of integrated function calls. The parameter RelAccuracy is not accounted for by the algorithm in this case (return result with some lower accuracy). But if the return value of integrated function multiply by 10^38 and then multiply the result of integration by 10^-38 then the integration gives the correct result with appropriate number of integrand calls. The parameter RelAccuracy then does work in this case.

Serialization for those types is provided by `{Serialize,Deserialize}LocatorPayloadXxx()`. - For non-disk locators (i.e., those with `T == 1`), add a _Reserved_ 8bit field that can be used by concrete backends to store 8bits of additional information per locator. To accommodate that, _Size_ has been reduced to 16 bits, i.e. the maximum size of a locator is now 64kB, which is still enough. - Explicitly store the locator type in a dedicated member in the `RNTupleLocator` structure. This makes it possible to have different type values even if the payload structure is identical, i.e. use the same alternative in the `fPosition` variant. **NOTE:** given the reorder of members, `sizeof(RNTupleLocator)` is preserved before and after the changes in this branch, at least in x86_64 and libstdc++. - Reassign the first representable value for the _Type_ (0x01) for URI string locators. This makes the entire contiguous range [0x02, 0x7f] assignable for concrete backends. **NOTE:** given that URI locators were so far unused in produced files, the change should not break existing ntuples. - Provide a new locator payload format: `RNTupleLocatorObject64`. This structure groups common data for object stores using 64bit location information. In some cases, for locators referencing pages, this might not contain the full location of the content. In particular, concrete backends may use this information in conjunction with the cluster and column ID. - Assign the _Type_ `0x02` for DAOS (layout of payload is given by `RNTupleLocatorObject64`). - Update `specifications.md` accordingly.

Issue is not closed yet because the solution we have is not perfect, but there is a way of doing it already in `v628`: with the `RooBinIntegrator`. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11814. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11954. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8984. Issue is not closed yet because the solution still needs to be validated to the user, but patch is already merged to `master` and `v628` branch. **Other items** that still need to be done without any associated GitHub issue:. - [x] New test statistics should consider the `Offset()` command in `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`, @Zeff020. - [x] Write release notes for the change in the `KahanSum` class, @egpbos. - [x] If you run the `testInterface` unit test binary in `roofitcore`, you get errors printed out and there is one disabled test. Please take a look, @Zeff020. **Backports** that need to be made for the v6.28 branch (in this particular order from top to bottom, to not have a commit history too different from master):. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11940. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11941. - [x] https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10210.

Therefore one always should use unique names. Also type of created variable always should be specified - at least `auto`. Now one can store geometry which is defined in `tutorials/geom/mp3player.C` macro together with all other components. Adjust `tutorials/geom/mp3player.C` macro to avoid many duplicated transformation objects - it is enough to have few of them. Do not use canvas with spaces in names in `tutorials/geom/geodemo.C`.,MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11900
