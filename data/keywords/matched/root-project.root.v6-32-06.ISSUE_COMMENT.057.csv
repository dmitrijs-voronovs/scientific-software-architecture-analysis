I don't think I have the permissions to be able to do this in this pull request (if I do I cannot see how to do it). We could close this pull request and I can do it on my own branch and then submit another pull request, or I think you have permissions to do it when accepting the merge by selecting ""Squash and merge"".

Yes, see for example https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/view/ROOT/job/root-makedoc-v620/lastBuild/consoleText. and search there for ""Unsupported xml/html tag"". Maybe with the spaces instead of backtics it will link that better.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9999:51,deployability,releas,release,51,"> Thanks a lot for the backport! Unfortunately the release procedure in on the way done by @Axel-Naumann, so merging to this branch is blocked. I guess we can merge again and then put this into ROOT 6.26.02. Thanks for this fast response @guitargeek. So if I understand this correctly, we can't get this backported to the next ROOT release `v6.26.0` and so we should get a patch like described in https://github.com/conda-forge/root-feedstock/issues/160 into conda-forge root, and then if Henry backports this into `v6.26.02` then in that release the banner onwards the banner will be gone (and then in conda-forge root we can drop the previous patch).
