Definition: A viral disorder generally characterized by high FEVER; COUGH; DYSPNEA; CHILLS; PERSISTENT TREMOR; MUSCLE PAIN; HEADACHE; SORE THROAT; a new loss of taste and/or smell (see AGEUSIA and ANOSMIA) and other symptoms of a VIRAL PNEUMONIA. In severe cases, a myriad of coagulopathy associated symptoms often correlating with COVID-19 severity is seen (e.g., BLOOD COAGULATION; THROMBOSIS; ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME; SEIZURES; HEART ATTACK; STROKE; multiple CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS; KIDNEY FAILURE; catastrophic ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODY SYNDROME and/or DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION). In younger patients, rare inflammatory syndromes are sometimes associated with COVID-19 (e.g., atypical KAWASAKI SYNDROME; TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME; pediatric multisystem inflammatory disease; and CYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME). A coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in the genus BETACORONAVIRUS is the causative agent. TUI(s): T047. Aliases (abbreviated, total: 47):. 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection, SARS-CoV-2 Disease, Human Coronavirus 2019 Infection, SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (disorder), Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, 2019 nCoV Disease, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19 Virus Disease, Virus Disease, COVID-19. ```. It also includes a small bug fix to the abbreviation detector. Note: The models (e.g. `en_core_sci_sm`) are still labeled as version `v0.5.1`, as this release did not involve retraining the base models, only the entity linkers. ## What's Changed. * Fix typo by @andyjessen in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/453. * Update README.md by @dakinggg in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/456. * Update to the latest UMLS version by @dakinggg in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/474. ## New Contributors. * @andyjessen made their first contribution in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/453. **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2",MatchSource.RELEASES,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/releases/tag/v0.5.2
