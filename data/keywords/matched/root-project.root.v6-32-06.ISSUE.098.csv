The check for the mod time is a ROOT specific patch introduced by commit 8d492b6b9ca359294d018995d097736f762866c8 we the commit log:. Make sure the inode did not get updated since we read it. During the upgrade to LLVM svn revision 214630, the code was sub-optimally merged with the new related code:. ```. + if (UFE.isValid()) { // Already have an entry with this inode, return it. +. + // FIXME: this hack ensures that if we look up a file by a virtual path in. + // the VFS that the getDir() will have the virtual path, even if we found. + // the file by a 'real' path first. This is required in order to find a. + // module's structure when its headers/module map are mapped in the VFS. + // We should remove this as soon as we can properly support a file having. + // multiple names. + if (DirInfo != UFE.Dir && Data.IsVFSMapped). + UFE.Dir = DirInfo;. + }. if (UFE.isValid() && Data.ModTime == UFE.ModTime) {. - // Already have an entry with this inode, return it. - // If the stat process opened the file, close it to avoid a FD leak. - if (F). - delete F;. -. return &UFE;. }. ```. where the new code (top part) should also have not been executed unless the UFE was actually returned. This also made meger the LLVM code more challenged were one the change was:. ```. - if (UFE.isValid()) { // Already have an entry with this inode, return it. + if (ReusingEntry) { // Already have an entry with this inode, return it. ```. this lead to the inadvertent removal of `UFE.isValid() conditional` in the patched part (and the forgetting of adding `ReusingEntry conditional`). This patch remerge the two section under the a single if statement.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14373
