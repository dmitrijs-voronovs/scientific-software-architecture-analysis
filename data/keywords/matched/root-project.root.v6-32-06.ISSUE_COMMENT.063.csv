Not really, the module `std.pcm` contains all of STL, however, some header files (which are implementation details such as the ones in `bits`) are re-exported from the submodules, that is, the submodule keeps a textual duplicate of the internal header. This in principle should only affect performance, however clang-9 has bugs when merging two definitions coming from the same textual header but re-exported by a different submodule. > . > * Also, isn't this compiler version dependent? STL is vendor dependent to the extent of the internal implemenation. The std.modulemap is the modulemap that ships with the gnu libstdc++. libc++ (used in osx) comes with its own modulemap which we happily find and use. The std.modulemap works (with minor tweaks from time to time) with libstdc++ from 5.1 to 11 (now you just enabled it for 12).

Indeed, you are right, I'm surprised by this behaviour though as the two interpolation methods for 1D and 2D do not require these conditions at all, . https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH2.html#abe951bf2a481efea09fc5ded972d739f. https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1.html#a8ca269364ca55ea1e7fb65f9d3b21722. It's funny that interpolation changes it's requirements based on the dimension... this forces me to scale whatever value is not between the extreme edge centers to be scaled to those centers. Guess I have no choice. This may be not a bug, but a lack of harmony between methods which should behave the same way, but then again, this is personal opinion. . Best,.
