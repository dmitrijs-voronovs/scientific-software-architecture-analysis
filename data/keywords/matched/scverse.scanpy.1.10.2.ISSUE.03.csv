https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/271:382,deployability,modul,module,382,"Define an extension mechanism; We should have a discussion about this separate from #265. There’s three options how to implement them. 1. Python has a built-in way of registering “entry points” which might be suitable. [A tutorial](https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2017/07/28/python-entry-points/). ```py. setup(. # ... entry_points={. 'scanpy.extensions': ['myextension = my.extension.module'],. },. ). ```. 2. Some projects have a module like `scanpy.ext`. An extension is a module installed into there (which is possible in python):. ```py. setup(. name='scanpy-ext-myextension',. # ... packages=['scanpy.ext.myextension'],. ). ```. 3.

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/273:517,usability,minim,minimal,517,"Reordering categories leads to issues with `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups` when using `method='logreg'`; Hi,. Reordering the categories of groups in obs leads to shuffling of marker genes to the wrong groups when using `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups`. Interestingly, this only happens if I use `method='logreg`. It works fine with `method='t-test`. I am not sure how relevant this is. Maybe, one should not reorder categories. However, this was helpful to me when I wanted to plot the categories in a certain order. Here comes a minimal example:. ```. import pandas as pd. import scanpy.api as sc. adata = sc.datasets.blobs(640, 3). sc.tl.pca(adata). sc.pp.neighbors(adata). sc.tl.louvain(adata). method='logreg'. sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain', method=method). print(pd.DataFrame(adata.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']).head(1)). adata.obs['louvain'].cat.reorder_categories(['2', '1', '0'], inplace = True). sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain', method=method). print(pd.DataFrame(adata.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']).head(1)). ```. The result looks like this:. ```python. 0 1 2. 0 570 63 126. 2 1 0. 0 570 63 126. ```. The expected result would be that the marker genes end up in the same groups as above (watch the change in the lowest row):. ```python. 0 1 2. 0 570 63 126. 2 1 0. 0 126 63 570. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/273

[Clustering 3k PBMCs following a Seurat Tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/scanpy_usage/blob/master/170505_seurat/seurat.ipynb). I hope this is the correct venue to post to regarding this. I'm currently going through this to learn how to use scanpy. In the first section. ```. path = './data/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/'. adata = sc.read(path + 'matrix.mtx', cache=True).T # transpose the data. genes = pd.read_csv(path + 'genes.tsv', header=None, sep='\t'). adata.var_names = genes[1]. adata.var['gene_ids'] = genes[0] # add the gene ids as annotation of the variables/genes. adata.obs_names = pd.read_csv(path + 'barcodes.tsv', header=None)[0]. ```. Due to how pandas dataframes indexes this part. ```. genes = pd.read_csv(path + 'genes.tsv', header=None, sep='\t'). adata.var_names = genes[1]. adata.var['gene_ids'] = genes[0] # add the gene ids as annotation of the variables/genes. ```. does not yield the expected results. As `var_names` becomes the index of `var` adding `genes[0]` will try to merge a data frame with unmatching index resulting in a `NaN` column in `var` for `'gene_ids'`. The solution should be either. ```. genes = genes.set_index(1). adata.var = genes. ```. or. ```. adata.var_names = genes[1]. genes = genes.set_index(1). adata.var['gene_ids'] = genes[0] # add the gene ids as annotation of the variables/genes. ``` .

We are working with a group of people at EBI, Sanger, U. of Freiburg, Earlham (Norwich), the US and Australia in trying to bring different single cell analysis tools to Galaxy and other workflow environments. For tools like Seurat, SC3 or Scanpy, which are normally used as libraries, we are writing an scripting layer for each of these to facilitate their use directly from the shell for well defined functionality (to be called then from whatever workflow environment people want to use). You can get an idea based on what we have here for Seurat for instance https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/r-seurat-scripts. We normally make a conda package out of this called \<tool\>-scripts.

My questions:. 1. Is re-running the above snippet supposed to give me the exact same results every time, or are there some random seeds used along the way? 2. If yes, how can one modify the code to ensure reproducibility? 3. Is there any way to modify the snippet to get the exact same results as shown here https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170522_visualizing_one_million_cells and in the published Scanpy paper? 4. If the answer to the previous question is no, could you make those results publicly available somewhere? I noticed the following warning from `sc.pp.neighbors` that might be relevant:. > WARNING: You're trying to run this on 1000 dimensions of `.X`, if you really want this, set `use_rep='X'`. Falling back to preprocessing with `sc.pp.pca` and default params. Note that scikit-learn's randomized PCA might not be exactly reproducible across different computational platforms.

Otherwise, the full matrix will be retained. - For CR-v3, `feature_types` was added into the outcome object as a new attribute. Added small test datasets and code for the revised functions to verify the expected behavior. Note for the `genome` argument:. - There is a genome argument in Scanpy's `read_10x_h5` function but not in `read_10x_mtx` as the genome was already specified by the path of input directory. The outcome object of the two functions should be the same which always take one genome at a time. - In this PR, when there are multiple genomes (e.g. Barnyard), `read_10x_mtx` always read them all, whereas `read_10x_h5` always need to specify one of them (mm10 by default). However, when `gex_only == False`, the `genome` argument will be ignored and the whole matrix will be read.",MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/334

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/349:325,deployability,scale,scale,325,Figures related to rankings and heatmap could be transposed.; These are some suggestions regarding visualization defaults. Working with the ranknings plot i realized that it would be much easier to read if the figure where transposed/rotated so that gene names could be read per line rather than per columns. This would also scale better if one wishes to plot more than 10-30 genes. There is no inherent information on the y axis that could not be layed out on the x axis. I also ran in to this format when using the heatmap plotting. Gene names are on the columns rather than rows resulting in a thin matrix and hard to read gene names. As the figure is constructed by using several axis one could transpose the figure having the gene names to the right colorbar on the right and groupings below or ontop of the heatmap. As one is most interested in a dendrogram on the cells (I think?) it could get a nice space on top.,MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/349
