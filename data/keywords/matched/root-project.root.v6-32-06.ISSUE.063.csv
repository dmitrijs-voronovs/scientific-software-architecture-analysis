Even though comparing the final. parameter errors would be redundant with the covariance matrix checks,. it's still important to check parameter errors for two reasons:. 1. Initial parameter errors need to be compared, because the the. initial error determins the initial step size which influences the. minimization path. If initial errors are different, the final. parameter values are almost never identical. Catching differences in initial parameter errors informs the user. that differences in fit result are because of the starting. conditions. 2. In the case of `RooFitResult::isIdenticalNoCov`, we need to check. the error of final parameters because there is no comparison of. covariance matrix values. The signature of the public function `isIdenticalNoCov` is extended by a. tolerance parameter for the error comparison. This is expected to not. break user code, because the function was only introduced in 6.26 and is. so far only used in a single unit test (`testSumW2Error`).

Please search in. * [GitHub](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues?q=is%3Aissue). * AND [Jira](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/issues/?jql=project %3D ROOT). for existing reports of your issue. If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"". -->. ### Describe the bug. Using a `std::pair` for a custom class inside another custom class seems to somehow break the dictionary load mechanism. In the [attached reproducer](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/8609137/reproducer.tar.gz), `OtherClass` contains a `std::pair<int, MyClass>`; for both custom classes a dictionary is created. Manually loading the dictionary in the Root shell seems to lead to an incomplete type state for `MyClass`, such that some assertions fail. The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`. It thus seems that the presence of the `std::pair` somehow interferes with loading the dictionary for the contained class. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. The presence of `std:::pair` should not interfere with the dictionary of its contained classes. ### To Reproduce. <!--.

Using a `std::pair` for a custom class inside another custom class seems to somehow break the dictionary load mechanism. In the [attached reproducer](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/8609137/reproducer.tar.gz), `OtherClass` contains a `std::pair<int, MyClass>`; for both custom classes a dictionary is created. Manually loading the dictionary in the Root shell seems to lead to an incomplete type state for `MyClass`, such that some assertions fail. The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`. It thus seems that the presence of the `std::pair` somehow interferes with loading the dictionary for the contained class. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. The presence of `std:::pair` should not interfere with the dictionary of its contained classes. ### To Reproduce. <!--.

Using a `std::pair` for a custom class inside another custom class seems to somehow break the dictionary load mechanism.

The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`. It thus seems that the presence of the `std::pair` somehow interferes with loading the dictionary for the contained class. ### Expected behavior. <!--.

Using a `std::pair` for a custom class inside another custom class seems to somehow break the dictionary load mechanism.

The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`.

Using a `std::pair` for a custom class inside another custom class seems to somehow break the dictionary load mechanism. In the [attached reproducer](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/8609137/reproducer.tar.gz), `OtherClass` contains a `std::pair<int, MyClass>`; for both custom classes a dictionary is created. Manually loading the dictionary in the Root shell seems to lead to an incomplete type state for `MyClass`, such that some assertions fail. The failure disappear if the same assertion is tested before on a class from the same dictionary and not encompassed in the `std::pair`. It thus seems that the presence of the `std::pair` somehow interferes with loading the dictionary for the contained class. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. The presence of `std:::pair` should not interfere with the dictionary of its contained classes. ### To Reproduce. <!--.

ROOT v6.24.06 is currently failing to build in Ubuntu 22.04. This appears to be due to an upgrade to [OpenSSL 3.0](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/07/OpenSSL3.Final/) with this new LTS release; you can see for example a similar issue [here](https://github.com/chris2511/xca/issues/320). The specific build error happens while building XROOTD. (I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to report the issue.). ### Expected behavior. ROOT builds without error using latest OpenSSL. ### To Reproduce. 1) Clean install of Ubuntu 22.04. 2) `sudo apt update`, followed by `sudo apt upgrade` and `sudo apt install` the required libraries for building ROOT. 3) Download ROOT source code and unzip. 4) Configure & build (using system Python 3.10). ### Setup. ROOT version: v6-24-06. Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (on Windows Subsystem for Linux / WSL2). How you obtained ROOT: building from source. ### Additional context. `root-v6-24-06/src/ROOT-build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-stamp/XROOTD-build-*.log` files are attached:.

The specific build error happens while building XROOTD. (I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to report the issue.). ### Expected behavior. ROOT builds without error using latest OpenSSL. ### To Reproduce. 1) Clean install of Ubuntu 22.04. 2) `sudo apt update`, followed by `sudo apt upgrade` and `sudo apt install` the required libraries for building ROOT. 3) Download ROOT source code and unzip. 4) Configure & build (using system Python 3.10). ### Setup.

The specific build error happens while building XROOTD. (I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to report the issue.). ### Expected behavior. ROOT builds without error using latest OpenSSL. ### To Reproduce. 1) Clean install of Ubuntu 22.04. 2) `sudo apt update`, followed by `sudo apt upgrade` and `sudo apt install` the required libraries for building ROOT. 3) Download ROOT source code and unzip. 4) Configure & build (using system Python 3.10). ### Setup.

ROOT v6.24.06 is currently failing to build in Ubuntu 22.04. This appears to be due to an upgrade to [OpenSSL 3.0](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/07/OpenSSL3.Final/) with this new LTS release; you can see for example a similar issue [here](https://github.com/chris2511/xca/issues/320). The specific build error happens while building XROOTD. (I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to report the issue.). ### Expected behavior. ROOT builds without error using latest OpenSSL. ### To Reproduce. 1) Clean install of Ubuntu 22.04. 2) `sudo apt update`, followed by `sudo apt upgrade` and `sudo apt install` the required libraries for building ROOT. 3) Download ROOT source code and unzip. 4) Configure & build (using system Python 3.10). ### Setup.

They are not destructed and recreated. - If the collection shrinks, the left-over elements need to be destructed to prevent memory leaks at the end of the event loop. - If the collection grows, the new elements need to be default constructed; the collection may need to move to a new memory location, in which case we should find a way to call copy/move constructor of the complex elements. - For efficiency, `RField` should know whether its type is trivially destructible and whether there is a copy/move constructor available .
