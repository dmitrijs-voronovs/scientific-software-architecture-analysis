I sourced dev3 on CVMFS, i.e. the LCG stack with ROOT master. In particular:. `source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/setup.sh`. and I tried to import ROOT from Python. When doing so, I observed the following error:. ```. error: entry with relative path at the root level is not discoverable. { 'name': '', 'type': 'directory',. ^~.

Note that the default flags for 'Debug' build are empty (on purpose, because compile flags are controlled by the package manager), and that this makes a string substitution command fail, likely because of lack of quoting some variable. I set `asserts` to `OFF` in the command line, though. Ideally, if something is exposed as an option to users, like `-Dasserts=ON` is, and it's set to `OFF` on the command line, it should not be altered by the build system, as that is surprising behavior. In any case, empty default flags (or even build type) is not something that should break configuration. Note that in multi-configuration generators, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is *always* empty, so the build system cannot assume it has any value.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8193
