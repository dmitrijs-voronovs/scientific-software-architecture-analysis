That's probably because those reads being filtered with `failed_too_short` even with filtering options disabled, were actually fully trimmed from the 5' end, due to low base quality at the first four bases. I used to get confused by this, too.

Unfortunately, if you also choose to perform the sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window, specifically by using `-r, --cut_right`, the whole sequence will be dropped from its 5' end, as the default sliding window size is four, and the default mean quality value for each window is 20. . Just it could be confusing to label the same failure reason for reads that are too short after trimming (more than 1 nt), as well as reads that are fully discarded after trimming. Also default filtering of the latter kind of reads is not reported in the stderr as 'reads failed due to too short: xxx', which raises inconsistency between the txt summary and html report, as well as confusions like 'how could I miss those reads since no filterings have been performed?'. .

If you know the true encoding, the worst quality score under that encodiding, and the worst quality reported by fastp, you should be able to infer the encoding assummed by fastp from the offset:. In your case, a 40 turns into a 70, so you have a shift of 30. If FASTQC determined the encoding to be Illumina 1.5, that implies a 'correct' offest of 64 (See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding) for an overview of PHRED encodings). So to get to the 70, fastp must have used an offset of 34. However, I find it likely, there is an off-by-one error here and the actual offset used by fastp was 33, which would correspond to the Sange/Illumina 1.8/PacBio encoding. If I have an old datset using an unknown encoding, I typically check for reads that are all 'N's (unfiltered raw sequencing data usually contain at least a few failed clusters that get reported as such) and inspect their quality score: In my experience this always corresponds to the worst quality score possible under the encoding used. So if the all-'N' reads have an all-'I' quality, I interpret this as Sanger encoding being used. If they are all-'h', Solexa or Illimina 1.3 remain, in which case I usually know the platform that was used. Analogously, all-'j' quality all-'N' reads indicate Illumina 1.5 and all-'J' ones Illumina 1.8 encoding. With PacBio I don't know if one can expect such indicative reads but the read length alone should make it obviuous in that case. I hope this helps,.

""conda install -c bioconda fastp"" installs version 0.12.4. ""conda install -c bioconda/label/cf201901 fastp"" installs version 0.19.5. I would like to use these two arguments: --detect_adapter_for_pe and --cut_tail. However, it looks like --detect_adapter_for_pe isn't in 0.12.4 and --cut_tail isn't in 0.19.5. As an example, I get the message ""undefined option: --cut_tail"". I created a new conda environment to ensure there were no conflicts and the problem is still there.

These are the steps I followed:. 1. Add `bioconda` and `conda-forge` as the priority channels for the installation of packages. This will allow for the newest version of `fastp` . Run the following commands to add the channels:. ```. conda config --add channels bioconda. conda config --add channels conda-forge. ```. 2. Create a new `conda` environment (I specified `python=3.9`, not sure if it is necessary). ```. conda create -n my_env python=3.9. ```. 3. All packages should be installed from the `conda-forge` channel, but just to make sure activate the environment and run. ```. conda update --all. ```. 4.

But `fastp` is nice, just run it twice:. ```. fastp ... \. --trim_front1 1 --trim_front1 1 \. --stdout | fastp --stdin \. -U --umi_loc per_read --umi_prefix UMI --umi_len 3 --umi_skip 3 . ```. Even in case `fastp` trimmed before extracting UMIs and restarted counting bases after global trimming, this makes your intentions explicit and it easier for others to follow your code. Note, that `fastp` will most likely never be the bottleneck of your analysis. Alternatively you could just keep the first base as part of the UMI and, if necessary, remove it later.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/417

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/558:760,deployability,continu,continue,760,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/562:768,usability,usab,usable,768,"My test dataset is too large to share, but here is the exact fastp call I used. `fastp -i SRR13921546_sub_1.fastq.gz -I SRR13921546_sub_2.fastq.gz -o SRR13921546_filter_1.fastq.gz -O SRR13921546_filter_2.fastq.gz -j SRR13921546_filter.json -w 1 --dedup`. I'm running in a modified version of this docker container which is based on ubuntu ""mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.8-jammy"". fastp installed with micromamba. `RUN micromamba create -q -y -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n fastp fastp=0.23.4 && micromamba clean --all -y`. I used `diff` to compare the .json file from multiple runs. Much of it is identical, but not entirely. I think I tried removing the dedup and that did not solve it. Only setting to 1 thread fixed it. . Honestly, fastp is so fast that 1 thread is still usable. Love the program and thanks for following up! EDIT:.
