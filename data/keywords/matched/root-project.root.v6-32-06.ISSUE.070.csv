Debugging the code, I can see that the TGeoMixture is supposed to contain fNelements=4 elements, and the last one is 0x0 hence the segfault when invoking A(). Digging further, I can see that the material is defined in DD4hep compact as:. ```. <!-- ### Pipe Supports Sintimid ### -->. <material name =""Pipe:Sintimid"">. <D type=""density"" value=""1.43"" unit=""g/cm3""/>. <composite ref=""C"" n=""18""/>. <composite ref=""O"" n=""5""/>. <composite ref=""N"" n=""2""/>. </material>. <!--### Pipe Supports Sintimid15G ###-->. <material name =""Pipe:Sintimid15G"">. <D type=""density"" value=""1.42"" unit=""g/cm3""/>. <fraction ref=""Pipe:Sintimid"" n=""0.85""/>. <fraction ref=""C"" n=""0.15""/>. </material>. ```. where the second mixture is a mixture of the first mixture and an element already present. ### Expected behavior. No segfault. ### To Reproduce. I have tried to reproduce the behaviour in a simple root macro:. ```. void test_mixture(). {. TGeoManager *geom = new TGeoManager("""","""");. TGeoElementTable *table = gGeoManager->GetElementTable();. TGeoElement *c = table->GetElement(6);. TGeoElement *n = table->GetElement(7);. TGeoElement *o = table->GetElement(8);. . TGeoMixture *mix = new TGeoMixture(""Pipe:Sintimid"", 3, 1.43);. double cc = 18 * c->A();. double cn = 2 * n->A();. double co = 5 * o->A();. double total = cc + cn + co;. mix->AddElement(c, cc/total);. mix->AddElement(n, cn/total);. mix->AddElement(o, co/total);. mix->Print();. TGeoMixture *mix2 = new TGeoMixture(""Pipe:Sintimid15G"", 2, 1.42);. mix2->AddElement(mix, 0.85);. mix2->AddElement(c, 0.15);. mix2->Print();. std::cout << ""Number of elements:"" << mix2->GetNelements() << '\n';. for(int i=0; i< mix2->GetNelements(); i++) {. std::cout << ""Element "" << i << "": "" << mix2->GetElement(i)->GetName() << '\n'; . }. mix2->ComputeDerivedQuantities();. }. ``` . reproduces the segfault with v6-26-00-patches, whereas 6.24.06 run",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11272

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11304:724,deployability,version,version,724,"WW option for fit functions as the W option; - [ x ] Checked for duplicates. ### Describe the bug. When fitting a histogram using the ""WW"" option for TH1::Fit(), i.e. ```. hist->Fit(func,""WW"");. ```. The fit ignores bins with zero counts, i.e. the same as the ""W"" option. ### Expected behavior. Fit should proceed with all bins with a weight of 1, even those with no counts. ### To Reproduce. ``` TH1D *hist = new TH1D(""hist"", ""hist"", 100, 0, 100);. TF1 *func = new TF1(""func"", ""[0]"", 0, 100);. func->SetParameter(0, 1);. . hist->FillRandom(""func"", 10); //add sparse counts. hist->Draw(""hist"");. hist->Fit(func, ""WWR"");. func->Draw(""hist same"");. . std::cout << func->GetParameter(0) << std::endl; . ```. ### Setup. 1. ROOT version 6.27/01. 2. MacOS 12.5.1. 3. ROOT compiled from source. ### Additional context. This is pretty clear from the ROOT::Fit::FitOptionsMake function [here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/HFitImpl_8cxx_source.html#l00684), where on line 728 the WW option is set (correctly), and then on line 780 the W option is checked for, and overwrites the WW option flag. A trivial check that the WW option is not present at line 780, or that ```fitOption.W1 != 2``` fixes the issue, i.e. change line 780 to. ```. if (!opt.Contains(""WW"") && opt.Contains(""W"")) fitOption.W1 = 1; // all non-empty bins have weight =1 (for chi2 fit). ```. or . ```. if (fitOption.W1 !=2 && opt.Contains(""W"")) fitOption.W1 = 1; // all non-empty bins have weight =1 (for chi2 fit). ```.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11304

A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is. -->. RooProdPdf can accept the parameter Conditional, which tells RooFit what observables this pdf needs to be normalized on. . This parameter has two forms:. * pdf, normalization observables, depsAreCond = false (default). * pdf, conditional observables, depsAreCond = true. The two forms are supposed to be identical if {conditional observables} = {all observables} - {normalization observables}. This is true when not using BatchMode. With BatchMode on (cpu) instead what happens is that depsAreCond is always considered false and the pdf behaves as if conditional observables were normalization. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. No difference between the two forms of the RooProdPdf, even when using BatchMode. ### To Reproduce. <!--. Steps to reproduce the behavior:. 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves. 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files! 3.

When adding two histograms, the weights associated with the bin contents of those histograms should also be added appropriately. `THnSparse` does not do this. It still reports the weights of the first histogram, ignoring the second. ### Expected behavior. The sum of weights should include the weights of both histograms that were added together. ### To Reproduce. The script is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5wvixrmdtdx3b5/testTHNadd.C?dl=0.

This issue was addressed here: https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3914, but it is present in ROOT 6.14/09. ### Describe the bug. The hadd ""-v 0"" option to set the verbosity level to 0 does not work in ROOT 6.14/09. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. Here is an example of running hadd on two files to create an output file. ```. hadd target.root file_1.root file_2.root. hadd Target file: target.root. hadd compression setting for all ouput: 1. hadd Source file 1: file_1.root. hadd Source file 2: file_2.root. hadd Target path: target.root:/. hadd Target path: target.root:/Histograms. ```. Result: target.root created containing a tree with the expected number of entries. I would like to use the ""-v 0"" option for hadd to set the verbosity level to 0 as described by the program info. ```. hadd. Usage: hadd [-f[fk][0-9]] [-k] [-T] [-O] [-a]. [-n maxopenedfiles] [-cachesize size] [-j ncpus] [-v [verbosity]]. targetfile source1 [source2 source3 ...]. If the option -v is used, explicitly set the verbosity level;. 0 request no output, 99 is the default. ```. ### To Reproduce. <!--. Steps to reproduce the behavior:. 1.

Since ROOT 6.26, there is a new range overlap check when calling the `createNLL` from a `RooAbsPdf` instance with a `Range` argument that contains multiple range names. However, it ignores the fact that when the `SplitRange` option is used, the name of the range to be checked should be appended by the appropriate category label from each category of the simultaneous pdf. This causes an exception to be falsely raised even if the ranges do not overlap.
