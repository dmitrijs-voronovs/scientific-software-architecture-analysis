Id like for scispacy to have a trained entity linker (that compares the textual context with the entity definitions) on top of the entity linking (more of a candidate generator) that we added a while ago, but it's not something I've had time to do. I also haven't looked at spacys native entity linker, but that would be the natural place to start.

Any longer distance between the two parens would have been filtered out, and if `receptor` didn't happen to match the other `receptor` it also wouldn't have gotten through, this was right on the edge.

I tried to create a conda environment and install nmslib using the CFLAGS statement and pip install from the cmd line but got an error message about pip? One thing I did not mention before is that my OS is Ventura (macOS13) and I have lockdown mode turned on. Hasn't been an issue with other python libs but maybe there are some dependencies in scispacy that could be affected? I look forward to any updates in scispacy and will surely try again to install.

I tried to create a conda environment and install nmslib using the CFLAGS statement and pip install from the cmd line but got an error message about pip? One thing I did not mention before is that my OS is Ventura (macOS13) and I have lockdown mode turned on. Hasn't been an issue with other python libs but maybe there are some dependencies in scispacy that could be affected? I look forward to any updates in scispacy and will surely try again to install.

https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/455:159,usability,error,error,159,"Thanks for your reply Daniel. I tried to create a conda environment and install nmslib using the CFLAGS statement and pip install from the cmd line but got an error message about pip? One thing I did not mention before is that my OS is Ventura (macOS13) and I have lockdown mode turned on. Hasn't been an issue with other python libs but maybe there are some dependencies in scispacy that could be affected? I look forward to any updates in scispacy and will surely try again to install.

I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy? I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this.

I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy? I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this.

I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy? I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this.

https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/455:728,usability,User,Users,728,"Hi Daniel,. I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy? I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this. Cheers, Brian. ### create env log ###. (base) ***@***.*** ~ % conda create -n scispacy python=3.9. Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done.

If you're interested, I'm happy to help you through all the steps that would be necessary in order to fully replace nmslib with annoy, but there are a few :) Basically it comes down to rebuilding the indexes and then testing them. To rebuild the indexes, you would need to get the [create linker](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scripts/create_linker.py) script to run and produce the necessary artifacts. The input paths for that script can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scispacy/linking_utils.py). Once you have the linkers created, we would need to test a few things. 1. The accuracy is roughly similar to the accuracy using nmslib. You can check that by running the [evaluation script](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/evaluation/evaluate_linker.py). The accuracy should be roughly as below for the main UMLS linker. Note: running the eval script (and development in general) will require that you install scispacy from source with `pip install -e .`. ```. Total entities: 70262.

If you're interested, I'm happy to help you through all the steps that would be necessary in order to fully replace nmslib with annoy, but there are a few :) Basically it comes down to rebuilding the indexes and then testing them. To rebuild the indexes, you would need to get the [create linker](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scripts/create_linker.py) script to run and produce the necessary artifacts. The input paths for that script can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scispacy/linking_utils.py). Once you have the linkers created, we would need to test a few things. 1. The accuracy is roughly similar to the accuracy using nmslib. You can check that by running the [evaluation script](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/evaluation/evaluate_linker.py). The accuracy should be roughly as below for the main UMLS linker. Note: running the eval script (and development in general) will require that you install scispacy from source with `pip install -e .`. ```. Total entities: 70262.

https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/481:476,usability,input,input,476,"Hi @nanthony007, thanks for making a start at this! If you're interested, I'm happy to help you through all the steps that would be necessary in order to fully replace nmslib with annoy, but there are a few :) Basically it comes down to rebuilding the indexes and then testing them. To rebuild the indexes, you would need to get the [create linker](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scripts/create_linker.py) script to run and produce the necessary artifacts. The input paths for that script can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/scispacy/linking_utils.py). Once you have the linkers created, we would need to test a few things. 1. The accuracy is roughly similar to the accuracy using nmslib. You can check that by running the [evaluation script](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/main/evaluation/evaluate_linker.py). The accuracy should be roughly as below for the main UMLS linker. Note: running the eval script (and development in general) will require that you install scispacy from source with `pip install -e .`. ```. Total entities: 70262. Correct at 1: 39170 Recall at 1: 0.5574848424468418. Correct at 2: 46132 Recall at 2: 0.6565711195240671. Correct at 10: 53370 Recall at 10: 0.759585551222567. Correct at 40: 55821 Recall at 40: 0.7944692721527995. ```. 2. The speed is roughly similar to nmslib. I haven't written a speed benchmarking script for the linker, but it should be fairly straightforward, and I can measure the speed of nmslib for the new method if needed. 3. The file size is roughly similar to nmslib. If annoy produces files that are much larger than the files that nmslib produces, that might be a problem. I don't have any reason to think it would, just something to check. If we get through all of that, I can upload the new files to s3, and do a new release that removes the nmslib dependency.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/481
