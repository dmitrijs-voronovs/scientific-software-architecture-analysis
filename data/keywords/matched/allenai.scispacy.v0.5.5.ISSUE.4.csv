I have it running with no problem in a different environment with internet connection. So I also have tried copying the files downloaded by the script instead of those I downloaded using the browser. The difference is that the file names contains a hash (?), like this:. ```. 1a5445257d097c1d2a9eba040029329993377ebc82785ee9ad18ed2b86f7fc7d.bc94249222c42b975a55db3a2b6f7badffe87b809e02f16907fca650f787f2f3.concept_aliases.json. ... ```. After copying those files to the environment with no internet access, repointing them in candidate_generator,py, the error continues. If I try to run the same code, but using 'umls' instead of 'mesh' (and also downloading the files manually, copying to the server and changing in candidate_generator.py), it works!

On the other hand, the `en_core_sci_sm` model identifies ""inherited"" and ""motor neuron disease"" as separate entities, each of which have matches above the 0.85 mention threshold. Therefore, it may generally be helpful to also keep track of any related original, unconsolidated entities from each model and pick the next longest phrased entities that have matching results above the desired mention threshold. Overall, a function with the following components would be roughly what I'm looking for:. - Parameters to take in:. - The text string from which entities will be identified. - A boolean for whether or not to identify the long forms of abbreviations as entities. (e.g., True). - A list of the desired models to use (e.g., [""en_core_sci_sm"", ""en_core_sci_scibert"", ""en_ner_bc5cdr_md""]). - A dictionary with any desired configurations of the scispacy linker, including the linker name (e.g.,",MatchSource.ISSUE,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/388

Similarly, some models may identify fragments of a phrase as separate entities while another model may recognize a whole phrase as one entity. Or, some models may recognize certain entities while other models may completely ignore them. If there is some way of consolidating entities found by different models, then a more accurate and complete list of entities will be obtained than just using any given model individually. There are also times when a longer phrased entity is not always better, because it may yield poor matching results that are below the desired mention threshold for a given knowledge base. For example, in the [ScispaCy Demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org/), the `en_core_sci_md` model identifies ""inherited motor neuron disease"" as an entity but gives no results satisfying the mention threshold of 0.85. On the other hand, the `en_core_sci_sm` model identifies ""inherited"" and ""motor neuron disease"" as separate entities, each of which have matches above the 0.85 mention threshold. Therefore, it may generally be helpful to also keep track of any related original, unconsolidated entities from each model and pick the next longest phrased entities that have matching results above the desired mention threshold.
