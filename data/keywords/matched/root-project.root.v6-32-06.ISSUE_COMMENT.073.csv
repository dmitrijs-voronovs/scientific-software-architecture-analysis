Why not adding an extra constructors taking double for some of these pdf's In addition I would make this only for the pdf variables that make sense to use numbers, and this should not be the `x` of a Gaussian or Landau.

That type of failures in fact boils down to this same issue. It can happen that two tasks get assigned to the same Dask worker process in the CI. The first task runs normally the DefinePerSample operation (after having jitted the computation graph). The second task clones the actions of the first in order to re-use the already jitted nodes. This also means that the `RDefinePerSample` object that was created during the first task will be reused.

That type of failures in fact boils down to this same issue. It can happen that two tasks get assigned to the same Dask worker process in the CI. The first task runs normally the DefinePerSample operation (after having jitted the computation graph). The second task clones the actions of the first in order to re-use the already jitted nodes. This also means that the `RDefinePerSample` object that was created during the first task will be reused. But the corresponding callback has been deleted at the end of the first event loop by RLoopManager at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/fa46203074cd4eb596b3f607f13cf4d7b6c6a433/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L764 .

That type of failures in fact boils down to this same issue. It can happen that two tasks get assigned to the same Dask worker process in the CI. The first task runs normally the DefinePerSample operation (after having jitted the computation graph). The second task clones the actions of the first in order to re-use the already jitted nodes. This also means that the `RDefinePerSample` object that was created during the first task will be reused.

Exception: ""RuntimeError('C++ exception thrown:\\n\\truntime_error: Graph was applied to a mix of scalar values and collections. This is not supported.'). ```. That type of failures in fact boils down to this same issue. It can happen that two tasks get assigned to the same Dask worker process in the CI. The first task runs normally the DefinePerSample operation (after having jitted the computation graph). The second task clones the actions of the first in order to re-use the already jitted nodes. This also means that the `RDefinePerSample` object that was created during the first task will be reused. But the corresponding callback has been deleted at the end of the first event loop by RLoopManager at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/fa46203074cd4eb596b3f607f13cf4d7b6c6a433/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L764 .

This is my current understanding of what is happening:. 1. The test wants to write a `RH1D` into a `TMemFile` (frame 74) so Cling has to load the `TClassInfo` (frame 60) and calls `RequireCompleteDeclContext` (frame 58). 2. This ends up in `RequireCompleteType` looking for `RHist<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (frames 56-59). 3. Because it's not yet complete, Clang starts `InstantiateClassTemplateSpecialization` (frame 48), which visits the `friend` declaration for `HistFromImpl<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (around frame 45). 4. Clang does some magic for deducing the template arguments and eventually decides to ask `FunctionTemplateDecl::findSpecialization` (frame 24), that in turn begins to `loadLazySpecializationsImpl` (frame 22). *Note* that this is the place where this PR ""fixes"" lazy loading / deserialization! 5. The `ASTReader` kicks in with `ReadDeclRecord` (frame 16). 6. After deserlization, the `ASTReader` performs the `diagnoseOdrViolations` (frame 13), which eventually trys to `getODRHash` of `RHist::GetNDim`. Do I interpret this correctly that we are instantiating `RHist` and then later on find it in a module while deserializing `HistFromImpl`? How can this be? @vgvassilev",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12062

This is my current understanding of what is happening:. 1. The test wants to write a `RH1D` into a `TMemFile` (frame 74) so Cling has to load the `TClassInfo` (frame 60) and calls `RequireCompleteDeclContext` (frame 58). 2. This ends up in `RequireCompleteType` looking for `RHist<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (frames 56-59). 3. Because it's not yet complete, Clang starts `InstantiateClassTemplateSpecialization` (frame 48), which visits the `friend` declaration for `HistFromImpl<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (around frame 45). 4. Clang does some magic for deducing the template arguments and eventually decides to ask `FunctionTemplateDecl::findSpecialization` (frame 24), that in turn begins to `loadLazySpecializationsImpl` (frame 22). *Note* that this is the place where this PR ""fixes"" lazy loading / deserialization! 5. The `ASTReader` kicks in with `ReadDeclRecord` (frame 16). 6. After deserlization, the `ASTReader` performs the `diagnoseOdrViolations` (frame 13), which eventually trys to `getODRHash` of `RHist::GetNDim`. Do I interpret this correctly that we are instantiating `RHist` and then later on find it in a module while deserializing `HistFromImpl`? How can this be? @vgvassilev",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12062

This is my current understanding of what is happening:. 1. The test wants to write a `RH1D` into a `TMemFile` (frame 74) so Cling has to load the `TClassInfo` (frame 60) and calls `RequireCompleteDeclContext` (frame 58). 2. This ends up in `RequireCompleteType` looking for `RHist<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (frames 56-59). 3. Because it's not yet complete, Clang starts `InstantiateClassTemplateSpecialization` (frame 48), which visits the `friend` declaration for `HistFromImpl<1, double, RHistStatContent, RHistStatUncertainty>` (around frame 45). 4. Clang does some magic for deducing the template arguments and eventually decides to ask `FunctionTemplateDecl::findSpecialization` (frame 24), that in turn begins to `loadLazySpecializationsImpl` (frame 22). *Note* that this is the place where this PR ""fixes"" lazy loading / deserialization! 5. The `ASTReader` kicks in with `ReadDeclRecord` (frame 16). 6. After deserlization, the `ASTReader` performs the `diagnoseOdrViolations` (frame 13), which eventually trys to `getODRHash` of `RHist::GetNDim`. Do I interpret this correctly that we are instantiating `RHist` and then later on find it in a module while deserializing `HistFromImpl`?

It was missed by the macOS builds that are run in pull requests. ```diff. diff --git a/core/macosx/CMakeLists.txt b/core/macosx/CMakeLists.txt. index 35de15157d..9c62337f98 100644. --- a/core/macosx/CMakeLists.txt. +++ b/core/macosx/CMakeLists.txt. @@ -29,6 +29,7 @@ if(cocoa). ). . target_compile_options(Macosx PRIVATE -ObjC++). + target_include_directories(Macosx PRIVATE ../unix/inc). . target_sources(Core PRIVATE $<TARGET_OBJECTS:Macosx>). ```.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12130

Sure, `RNTupleGlobalRange` and `RNTupleClusterRange` before this PR are defined as forward ranges. So they can basically be used in a range-for loop and for STL algorithms, but they will use slower versions in some cases, because of the less capable iterator category. A good example is that `std::distance(globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end())` unnecessarily has linear complexity, although it could easility be constant. This effects us a lot as well for the parallel STL. E.g. spanning a parallel index space:. ```c++. std::for_each(std::execution::par, globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end(), [](NTupleSize_t i) { ... });. ```. This has unnecessary complex setup time, because partitioning the index space has linear complexity due to the iterator category. The support for C++20 ranges is orthogonal to these usuability improvements, but should fall out for free.

Sure, `RNTupleGlobalRange` and `RNTupleClusterRange` before this PR are defined as forward ranges. So they can basically be used in a range-for loop and for STL algorithms, but they will use slower versions in some cases, because of the less capable iterator category. A good example is that `std::distance(globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end())` unnecessarily has linear complexity, although it could easility be constant. This effects us a lot as well for the parallel STL. E.g. spanning a parallel index space:. ```c++. std::for_each(std::execution::par, globalRange.begin(), globalRange.end(), [](NTupleSize_t i) { ... });. ```. This has unnecessary complex setup time, because partitioning the index space has linear complexity due to the iterator category. The support for C++20 ranges is orthogonal to these usuability improvements, but should fall out for free.
