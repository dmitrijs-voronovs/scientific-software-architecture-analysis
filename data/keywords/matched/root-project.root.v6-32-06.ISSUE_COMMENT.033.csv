Libraries are free to use the interpreter during their static initialization after being loaded. In that case this library decided to add an extra include path. If we do not need this include path (eg there is no useful header to resolve from there). In fact we ignore such include paths [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/666cd7981afcaeed4728c86591cbdfa5e20df4d2/cmake/modules/RootMacros.cmake#L329). What is `build_dbg_includepaths`?

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7115:70,safety,reme,remember,70,"Hello,. No, Jira it says that the fixes are in 6.22.02 and 6.24.00. I remember that there were two related but different problems with the polygons. One was fixed a while back, it should be somewhere in 6.20, but the second one only in the versions mentioned above. If you can, try out ROOT's nightly on lxplus. If it's fixed, all good. If it persists, there is a third thing going on, and you should open a ticket. If it's all OK in the above versions, but you cannot use those, you can ask guitargeek very nicely to port the fix to the next 6.20.xx.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7115

I tested the code now with a modified `rooArgusModel` example from https://root.cern/manual/roofit/. What I changed:. * Number of generated toy events increased from 2000 to 200000. * Changed fitting command to `model.fitTo(*data, RooFit::Offset(true), RooFit::Extended(false));`. The offset has to be enabled to cover the changes suggested in this PR. The extended term has to be disabled for the same reason that the offset subtraction has been changed in this PR: the extra term is of the similar order of magnitude as the Kahan sum over events but is summed with the Kahan algorithm. Therefore, the carry is lost and becomes zero. But if the carry is zero, we can't see what's different in the offset subtraction with this PR. In the first three iterations, I printed the result and carry before and after offset subtraction (without this PR):. ```. Without PR. 1.

The result in the second lines is identical to the final result without this PR, indicating that the carries of offset and result were indeed lost before the PR. After the dummy addition of zero, the result changes visibly. This is expected, because after the offset subtraction the result shrinks by orders of magnitudes and can absorb (parts of) the carry. What is surprising is that the carry is zero afterwards. I would have expected that a carry of around 1e-17 remains (i.e. that it shrinks in order of magnitude like the result after offset subtraction but it doesn't become zero). So this PR does what it should, except for the carry unexpectedly zero in the end. This is probably related to the result being a lot smaller after offset subtraction, but I don't understand it completely.
