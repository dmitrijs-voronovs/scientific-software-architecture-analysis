What I did : . - dropna(), still boolean values, which poses the same error again (boolean values are NANs appearently). - fillna(0) : replaced all NAN values with 0, but this poses a problem later in the analysis when i lognormalize the data (log(0) = inf). How do you guys deal with these sorts of problems with your data ? . I don't think the mt colum should contain boolean values... (cf. screeshot).

Thanks for the recommendation – I will check out Scanorama, been meaning to read the review on integration techniques. . > you will only get an integrated graph structure with this for scvelo, which may help a little, but won't remove the batch effect for RNA velocity calculation. scvelo doesn't currently have any batch removal in its pipeline as it is quite difficult to add as it works directly from the normalized count data and fits a model to these. Ahh okay, I misunderstood the process then – my understanding was that some of the mnn correction would be carried over when performing velocity analysis. I will check out the scvelo forum for info on comparing samples. .

This follows other tools better, which just throw an error if your parent directory doesn't exist. I personally like this approach better because it'll throw an error for typos, instead of doing the wrong thing. The only exception here is for the `datasets` module, which should create the directory it will store data in. I would recommend you explicitly create the directory in your code if needed. @falexwolf @flying-sheep, I would like to remove the directory creation code from `_check_datafile_present_and_download`. Do you think this will be a problem? It's not documented, so I'm leaning towards just removal instead of deprecation, but could be convinced to just warn for a cycle.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/1305

One aspect that would make it even easier to use the tool that we were missing in the comparison is a small tutorial.

The point of the tutorial is to easily become familiarized with Scanpy-based analysis of scRNA-seq data rather than to allow the exploration of a comprehensive dataset. Thus, the pbmc3k object is a reduced version of the one that can be downloaded from the 10X website to make everything run much faster. If you want to take a look at the full object, you would have to download the object from 10X and run the tutorial with that dataset (I believe it's called 2.7k PBMCs there). I'm not 100% sure how this object was generated, but I assume the number of genes were reduced to leave only the most highly variable genes in the dataset with sufficient levels of expression. This is often done in scRNA-seq analysis to reduce the number of features to calculate e.g., PCA-based embeddings for downstream analysis. Thus, it is not uncommon for some genes to not be taken into account when generating an embedding.

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/1338:1380,usability,user,user,1380,"Hi @LuckyMD ,. Thanks so much for getting back to me this quickly. I just want to clarify that I am not running this analysis with the built-in 10x data set, I have followed the tutorial as seen on the link in the report, which says: ""The data consist in 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor and are freely available from 10x Genomics"". I have downloaded the file from the following URL, as seen in the tutorial:. http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/1.1.0/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz. This is also the same URL found on this link, directly from 10x:. https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc3k. The 10x summary [here](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/1.1.0/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_web_summary.html) mentions LYZ as one of the most differentially expressed genes, yet it is missed by the sample analysis as performed in the Scanpy tutorial. As both use the exact same count matrix as a source, there are two possibilities here as far as I can see: either the thresholds and filtering parameters in the tutorial are inaccurate and miss important marker genes, or there is a bug that drops these genes. My question is which of the following is true. From your answer I would assume it's the former, in which case maybe a disclaimer pointing this out would be helpful in the tutorial page? I think, as it stands, the average user would assume important marker genes such as LYZ would not be missed by even a rough analysis of a PBMC data set.

The way that we assign colors to each obs is basically:. ```. values = adata.obs[categorical_column]. color_vector = np.asarray(adata.uns[color_key])[values.codes]. ```.

[Pandas does not allow you to make `NA` a category](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html#missing-data), so `NA` will always have a code of `-1`. I think handling of this could take some consideration. I'm not sure we can safely set a default color for missing categorical values since that color (or one that looks very similar) could already be used. That said, it could be much more complex to allow passing a color for missing values. It might be worth looking into how other plotting libraries deal with missing categorical values and color. .

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/1358:594,usability,workflow,workflows,594,"Just my 2cents: . I made really good experiences with Github actions. * I find them easy to set-up and they run many (20-40?) jobs in parallel. . * Really good integration with Github (e.g. upload to PyPI on release) . * windows testing works well, but it is a pain to setup pycairo, see [here](https://github.com/icbi-lab/scirpy/blob/725664a22e6265643633d89a7f38ea3383ccab48/.github/workflows/test.yml#L34) and [here](https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo/issues/19#issuecomment-638716293). .

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/1359:255,availability,consist,consistent,255,"CC @flying-sheep this is an untested as I don't have a windows machine handy to trigger the platform-int-size problem. I'm also somewhat guessing at the fix! From looking at the scanpy source, I don't think that changing the `dtype` of `ns` to a platform consistent and wider `int` will do anything catastrophic to performance or alter the logic in the alg in which it's used as it seems to be a simple index. Hope this helps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/1359
