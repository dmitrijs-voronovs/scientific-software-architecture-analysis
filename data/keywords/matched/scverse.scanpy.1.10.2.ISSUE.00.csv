https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/74:897,usability,user,user-images,897,"Problem adding sample annotation by pd.dataframe ; Hi Alex, thank you for this amazing package. I would like to use it for my analysis, but I cannot figure it out why I'm getting this error when I try to include more annotation on my samples. . Basically, I was following your example here: . import pandas as pd. anno = pd.read_csv(filename_sample_annotation). adata.obs['cell_groups'] = anno['cell_groups'] . However, when I tried with my cvs file, I got Nan for each row and I don't understand. . The pd data frame is fine, but then the data.var['key'] = NaN NaN NaN ... everywhere.. I post here my code: . **import pandas as pd. anno = pd.read_csv(path+'sample_anno.csv',header=0). anno.head(). adata.var['pools']= anno['pools']. adata.var**. ![updated_adata var](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20638667/35852492-59e9806c-0b2b-11e8-94e2-103c18792cbb.png). ![anno_dataframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20638667/35852504-5f5a04d6-0b2b-11e8-9c91-0e0d61da3810.png).

I have tried the [Moignard](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170501_moignard15) early blood development example and your results can be reproduced. However, I have some questions as follows. 1. What does the dpt_order in the final result mean? I thought it should be the order of cells according to their pseudotime. However, after checking the ""smp.csv"" in the generated data, it seems there is no correspondence between _dpt_order_ and _dpt_pseudotime_. For instance, the order of 3 cells with the smallest _dpt_pseudotime_ are 3308, 1813, 3301 respectively (instead of 0, 1, 2). 2. How to adjust the figure size of sc.pl.dpt? I have tried to put `plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))`, but it seems that it doesn't work. Maybe we have to plot each figure manually. . 3. Can we get information about branch assignment? In this example, there are two branches. How can we know which branch each cell belongs to if possible? Do we have to find this indirectly with the _dpt_group_ information?

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/106:27,availability,replic,replicates,27,"Best practice for handling replicates and associated statistics; I'm curious as to what would be the best practice for this situation... I have an np.array containing 18 expression values for gene y. There are 3 replicates, so 6 different conditions. . `adata.X[:,0] = [ 72. 92. 51. 93. 1. 46. 0. 33. 46. 75. 56. 28. 90. 100. 7. 25. 40. 81.]`. I need to calculate several values: replicate average, pvalue, FDR, standard error and standard deviation. Currently, I can calculate average for the replicates. The result for the above example is:. `adata.Xmean[:,0] = [71.6667 71.6667 71.6667 46.6667 46.6667 46.6667 26.3333 26.3333 26.3333 53. 53. 53. 65.6667 65.6667 65.6667 48.6667 48.6667 48.6667]`. This seems redundant as the average is listed for each replicate. It led me to think about separating the replicates into their own .X, like .X1 for replicate 1, .X2, etc. This would mean the .Xmean[0] would link to .X1[0], .X2[0], .X3[0]. . The averages may be the only one to benefit from this setup, as each replicate will have its' own p-value, FDR, standard error, and standard deviation. This makes me think the redundant .Xmean is the better approach. What are your thoughts?
