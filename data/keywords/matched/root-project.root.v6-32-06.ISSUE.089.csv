FreeBSD for some reason prints a warning (to stderr) when doing cleanup at exit, so root always prints the following out after exit:. __cxa_thread_call_dtors: dtr 0x82b2c78f0 from unloaded dso, skipping. so it confuses those tests which compare output to some reference output. I have patched my libc (lib/libc/stdlib/cxa_thread_atexit_impl.c) to not print this out (which fixes those tests) but that is not a generic way to go:). It would be good to have a look whether this can be somehow handled more gracefully in root internals (or possibly ignore stderr in tests?). ### Reproducer. ctest -V -R roottest-root-meta-MakeProject-examples. ### ROOT version. master. ### Installation method. source. ### Operating system.

(See: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/merge_requests/1028). As it happens, this didn't solve our original issue with an older version of [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB), but that I did not manage to reproduce with a standalone example yet, so let's ignore that one for now. (You can find some more info in: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/-/merge_requests/64172). But one issue that I found during this development is fairly easy to reproduce. It seems that one can not provide `-isystem` and `-D` command line options to `genreflex` in any order. Specifying `-D` flags after `-isystem` flags seems to not work. ### Reproducer.

With the following additional `selection.xml` file:. ```xml. <lcgdict>. <class name=""TypeWithDictionary"" />. </lcgdict>. ```. With these two, I can run the following happily:. ```.

Create a new file with the following ROOT macro:. ```. {. TFile f(""tree.root"", ""RECREATE"");. TTree tree(""NOMINAL"", ""NOMINAL"");. TLorentzVector my_vector;. auto branch = tree.Branch(""my_vector"", &my_vector);. for (UInt_t i=0; i<100; ++i) {. my_vector.SetXYZT(i,i,i,i);. tree.Fill();. }. tree.Write();. }. ```. Then, enforce the old `TRootBrowser` is used, e.g.:. ```. echo ""Browser.Name: TRootBrowser"" >> ~/.rootrc. ```. Finally, open the file inside a `TBrowser`. Then, click on the ROOT file, `NOMINAL`, `my_vector`, and finally double-click on `X()`. . With the new `ROOT::Experimental::RWebBrowserImp` browser, this works, with the classic `TRootBrowser` in recent ROOT versions, the histogram stays empty, with a manual `Draw()` command, it works. . ### ROOT version. ```. ------------------------------------------------------------------. | Welcome to ROOT 6.28/04 https://root.cern |. | (c) 1995-2022, The ROOT Team; conception: R.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13287:917,deployability,contain,contains,917,"[RF][HF] ShapeFactor with initial shape creates invalid HistFactory XML; ### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Expected: valid XML. To summarize:. - `ShapeFactor` can have init values for its nuisance parameters. - The documentation for `ShapeFactor` indicates settings both for reading/writing the initial shape (see `fhHigh` in the [source code](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/28c5ade5377bfb6b9025b79aa404d5270516af3c/roofit/histfactory/inc/RooStats/HistFactory/Systematics.h#L251)). - `ShapeFactor` inherits from `HistogramUncertaintyBase` which allows setting of some common attributes such as `HistoName` and `HistoPath` and `InputFile`. I can write valid code (in python, but assumed to be about the same as in C++) to create a valid `Measurement` that ROOT is happy with, however it is not serializable. ### Reproducer. Using the attached `data/data.root` which contains the histogram already with init values, you can run the following python code mainly inspired from the [hf001_example.C](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/hf001__example_8C.html) example:. ```python. import ROOT. from ROOT.RooStats import HistFactory as HiFa. Measurement = HiFa.Measurement. Sample = HiFa.Sample. Channel = HiFa.Channel.

Expected: valid XML. To summarize:. - `ShapeFactor` can have init values for its nuisance parameters. - The documentation for `ShapeFactor` indicates settings both for reading/writing the initial shape (see `fhHigh` in the [source code](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/28c5ade5377bfb6b9025b79aa404d5270516af3c/roofit/histfactory/inc/RooStats/HistFactory/Systematics.h#L251)). - `ShapeFactor` inherits from `HistogramUncertaintyBase` which allows setting of some common attributes such as `HistoName` and `HistoPath` and `InputFile`. I can write valid code (in python, but assumed to be about the same as in C++) to create a valid `Measurement` that ROOT is happy with, however it is not serializable. ### Reproducer.
