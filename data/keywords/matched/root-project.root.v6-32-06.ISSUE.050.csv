My idea is that in the end we'll only need to store `npartitions` and `tree` (which are always needed) plus `defaultbranches` and `friendinfo` as ""optional"" class attributes (meaning they are initialized to `None` and changed if some conditions apply). . For simplicity, in this PR I still leave `treename` and `inputfiles` attributes which are needed in the `Ranges.get_clusters` function. The next PRs will address:. * The assumption we only have one unique treename in the RDataFrame. * Change in `Ranges.get_clusters` to accept a `TTree` instance as argument, pairing it with new C++ functions in `ROOT::Internal::TreeUtils` to retrieve a vector of clusters (plus some other metadata) depending if it's a TTree or TChain. If the logic for this PR is approved I'll add more docs and commit messages",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8816

However, segmentation violation occurs when trying to redefine a defined column. ### Expected behavior. Defined columns are re-definable. ### To Reproduce. <!--. Steps to reproduce the behavior:. 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves. 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files! 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ... -->. 1.
