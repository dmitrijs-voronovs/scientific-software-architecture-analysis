First, all of the reads in this file which have sequence bases do have the correct number of quality values. The reads are not malformatted.

I believe (but am not certain) that DeepVariant is attempting to parse these reads, and this is causing the error. I was not able to confirm, since I wasn't able to find the reference genome used to map. These reads can be validly ignored by DeepVariant. If this is the case, there are a few options to proceed.

First, all of the reads in this file which have sequence bases do have the correct number of quality values. The reads are not malformatted. However, there are reads with the SAM flag 256, secondary alignment. This occurs when the mapper finds a place which is almost or as good to map the reads to. Not all mappers report secondary alignments, and this is often controlled by a parameter. These reads have neither sequence bases, nor quality values, but do have a CIGAR string. I believe (but am not certain) that DeepVariant is attempting to parse these reads, and this is causing the error. I was not able to confirm, since I wasn't able to find the reference genome used to map. These reads can be validly ignored by DeepVariant. If this is the case, there are a few options to proceed. First, I believe that if you perform the command: . ```. samtools view -bh -F 256 file.bam > new_file.bam. ```. The file should now work with DeepVariant. . One thing it might be good to consider, based on my inspection of the CIGAR strings, I think these are likely HiFi reads. The program tag for minimap indicates the parameter -ax map-pb. I think that parameter is optimized for CLR. I believe the parameter for CCS/HiFi is -ax asm20. We usually take mapped BAM files from pbmm2, which wraps minimap2 with parameters optimized for HiFi.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/434:1901,usability,close,closely,1901,"Hi @elcortegano . Thank you for the file, it's very informative, and I have a few observations that might help. First, all of the reads in this file which have sequence bases do have the correct number of quality values. The reads are not malformatted. However, there are reads with the SAM flag 256, secondary alignment. This occurs when the mapper finds a place which is almost or as good to map the reads to. Not all mappers report secondary alignments, and this is often controlled by a parameter. These reads have neither sequence bases, nor quality values, but do have a CIGAR string. I believe (but am not certain) that DeepVariant is attempting to parse these reads, and this is causing the error. I was not able to confirm, since I wasn't able to find the reference genome used to map. These reads can be validly ignored by DeepVariant. If this is the case, there are a few options to proceed. First, I believe that if you perform the command: . ```. samtools view -bh -F 256 file.bam > new_file.bam. ```. The file should now work with DeepVariant. . One thing it might be good to consider, based on my inspection of the CIGAR strings, I think these are likely HiFi reads. The program tag for minimap indicates the parameter -ax map-pb. I think that parameter is optimized for CLR. I believe the parameter for CCS/HiFi is -ax asm20. We usually take mapped BAM files from pbmm2, which wraps minimap2 with parameters optimized for HiFi.

From your description, it looks like you are running the DeepTrio merge component in the way that I would recommend. . Can I ask a few questions:. 1. Are you taking the values from the QUAL field of the multisample glnexus VCF. 2. How have you determined the TP sites? Are these Genome in a Bottle, or do they come from some other source. Your QUAL values for all calls match expectations for DeepTrio. However, I would not expect that ""true"" variants would have a distribution which departs from all calls. I can think of one reason that this might be the case:. Are these true variants de novos? DeepTrio's quality distribution for de novo variants is very different from its general quality distribution. This occurs because DeepTrio has learned that de novo events are quite rare, and so requires a higher standard of evidence to make a call which is a de novo. In these cases, DeepTrio is not extremely confident in the call, which results in a lower quality value. . The other things it might be good to look at is the genotype quality (GQ) field. This is the most direct measure of DeepTrio's confidence in a call, and maps directly from the probability for the called class. The QUAL value of a multisample VCF comes from GLnexus, and is a bit less direct measure of call confidence (still, I don't expect the distributions to be off in the manner that you see).

From your description, it looks like you are running the DeepTrio merge component in the way that I would recommend. . Can I ask a few questions:. 1. Are you taking the values from the QUAL field of the multisample glnexus VCF. 2. How have you determined the TP sites? Are these Genome in a Bottle, or do they come from some other source. Your QUAL values for all calls match expectations for DeepTrio. However, I would not expect that ""true"" variants would have a distribution which departs from all calls. I can think of one reason that this might be the case:. Are these true variants de novos? DeepTrio's quality distribution for de novo variants is very different from its general quality distribution. This occurs because DeepTrio has learned that de novo events are quite rare, and so requires a higher standard of evidence to make a call which is a de novo. In these cases, DeepTrio is not extremely confident in the call, which results in a lower quality value. . The other things it might be good to look at is the genotype quality (GQ) field. This is the most direct measure of DeepTrio's confidence in a call, and maps directly from the probability for the called class. The QUAL value of a multisample VCF comes from GLnexus, and is a bit less direct measure of call confidence (still, I don't expect the distributions to be off in the manner that you see).

This is expected the the found de novo calls are lower in confidence (because DeepTrio has learned that de novo events are rare). Given that a call is a de novo (0/1-0/0-0/0), the higher GQ values will still indicate higher confidence, so more confident de novo calls should be more likely to be true. For calls which are 1/1-0/0-1/1 (or permutations of this), the parent and child models of DeepTrio do not coordinate, so they aren't optimizing for consistency. There is a property of some regions which look like potential segmental duplications where a call that appears to a human as a 1/1/ or 0/1 is actually some kind of CNV. DeepTrio has learned some parts which are predictive of this (generally a variant-dense haplotype and a reference haplotype with higher depth). There may be cases where the child model gives a call a 1/1 and the parent gives a 0/0 when the site itself is similar, but the context is different. If you are looking for homozygous Mendelian violations, you may want to filter regions of high variant density, as apparent calls will come from this phenomenon. . In addition, if you are looking at the sex chromosomes, it would be good to separately call the non-PAR chrX for male samples.

This is expected the the found de novo calls are lower in confidence (because DeepTrio has learned that de novo events are rare). Given that a call is a de novo (0/1-0/0-0/0), the higher GQ values will still indicate higher confidence, so more confident de novo calls should be more likely to be true. For calls which are 1/1-0/0-1/1 (or permutations of this), the parent and child models of DeepTrio do not coordinate, so they aren't optimizing for consistency. There is a property of some regions which look like potential segmental duplications where a call that appears to a human as a 1/1/ or 0/1 is actually some kind of CNV. DeepTrio has learned some parts which are predictive of this (generally a variant-dense haplotype and a reference haplotype with higher depth). There may be cases where the child model gives a call a 1/1 and the parent gives a 0/0 when the site itself is similar, but the context is different. If you are looking for homozygous Mendelian violations, you may want to filter regions of high variant density, as apparent calls will come from this phenomenon. . In addition, if you are looking at the sex chromosomes, it would be good to separately call the non-PAR chrX for male samples.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/446:931,deployability,log,logs,931,"Thanks @pgrosu ! Follow up with you @ruolin , . I started a machine with:. `gcloud compute instances create --project OUR_PROJECT --zone us-west1-b --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud --image-family ubuntu-1804-lts --machine-type custom-64-131072 --min-cpu-platform ""Intel Skylake"" --boot-disk-size 300G pichuan-test-20210425`. which is a 64 core, 128 GB RAM machine, and the command finished running without any issue.

For this question, do you mean the ability to include statistics about reference confidence blocks in a GVCF format, or do you mean the ability to write a line in a VCF for every genome position (equivalent to the EMIT_ALL_SITES option of GATK). If you mean a GVCF, this can be done in DeepVariant by adding the flag ```--output_gvcf=${GVCF_FILE} ``` to the executed command. We generally feel that this provides sufficient statistics and information about reference confidence. We're hesitant to implement the one line per site feature due to how long it takes to write this amount of data and the file size. If this is the desire, is it tractable to get such statistics for support from tools like mosdepth or samtools? Thanks,.

Why not de novo variant call in the trio starting with the make examples step i.e. DeepDenovo? Not a filtering script. . Here is the reason:. When you classify the images of de novo variant candidates in the context of the child, parent 1 and parent 2 you can capture more information that you can not from individually calling the variants in each individual. The task of DeepDenovo would be to classify the de novo variant in the child as true 1 or false 0. It's presumed heterozygous state.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/451:983,availability,error,errors,983,"Hi @ASLeonard . This is an interesting question. The ability to sort reads and label them with a phasing tag (specifically HP) is general to DeepVariant (meaning that on the code level it is straightforward to add to DeepVariant). This feature is only used for long reads. We performed experiments in non-trio phasing of short reads, but found there is not enough information for local phasing to add information. . Trio phasing can be much more informative for short reads over long ranges. The main obstacle is that we do not have pre-trained models which have learned how to use this information as we have for long reads. It would, in theory, be possible to train models for this (though it would be a reasonable amount of work). One of the obstacles for us to do this is that we don't know what to recommend as the best practices for the trio binning process. . I don't think that variant calling on an assembly is necessarily a good idea, because the assembly itself will have errors, and the expected distribution of REF, HET, and HOM calls will be quite different from the typical variant calling problem. Assemblies are usually less complete than the reference, especially with short read data, and this is likely to create a lot of mapping artifacts. .

This work was specifically motivated by recent approaches like those in the VGP of using SNP/indels to polish large assemblies, and deepvariant being a top performing tool for this. Unfortunately, they don't use triobinning, and triobinning papers generally only polish with the binnable long reads, so perhaps this problem is currently unsolvable. I'll keep trying out some different ideas in case anything works, but thanks for the discussion.

My guess was that it had to do with sam parsing. . I'm curious for your opinion.. :). Annabel",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/457

Yes, the PacBio model is meant for HiFi reads only, but also DeepVariant is not going to perform well with a single read. For one thing, the very sensitive caller that finds candidates looks for 2 reads showing the same potential variant allele, but also the models are trained with coverages only as low as about 15X, so even if you changed the thresholds for candidate generation to 1 read, the model would probably call it not-a-real-variant (class 0). When you saw that DeepVariant finished but created 0 candidates, that is the expected behavior since the coverage is too low to create any candidates with 2+ supporting reads. You might want to check with PacBio what they recommend for calling variants from LAA, since I don't think DeepVariant would be your best choice for this type of data. Good luck!
