See for instance [this one](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/graphics/arrows.C). The header should be formatted that way with a proper author name at the end. 2. The description of the macro should be more than just a brief. May be some explanation about the site it refers to would help. In particular the download link should be to ScientificColourMaps7.zip I guess. 3. You are using a TTree do read the .txt file. Why not, but that might be a bit ""too much"" just to read an ascii file of 3 columns. A standard C/C++ ASCII file reading is enough. 4. The files have already 255 colors. So you do not need CreateGradientColorTable to interpolate the colors simply build the palette with the colors you read. 5.

PyROOT, which is building on top of cppyy, is very deeply connected to the CPython implementation of CPyCppyy.

So to support PyPy, we would have to rewrite [all this code](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/src), and work closely with the cppyy team to make sure it's PyPy implementation also provides the interfaces that PyROOT expects. That would be a *huge* amount of work with no usecase to justify it.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8112:840,deployability,log,log,840,"Hi @SimeonEhrig, I'm not sure backporting the fix is a) feasible and b) sufficient. As already mentioned in the other issue, that part of Clang has seen massive changes due to AMD upstreaming their HIP programming model (and fixing quite a number of CUDA issues along the way). The fix for `extern __constant__` is really only https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/b008ea304d438f0aa818918caceb3bd864412304 (but there are many other fixes for problems that you might or might not encounter later on); the reason I mentioned https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/0b2af1a2889423bb797856841ac81cf10d01c696 is that it refactored that part of the code and introduced the functions that are modified for the fix. I tried applying both of them (in chronological order, obviously) and it doesn't work cleanly. I had a quick look at `git log` for only `clang/lib/CodeGen/CGCUDANV.cpp` and found the massive https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/5be9b8cbe2b2253f78a09a863bef18e574737465 that overhauled the registration logic to add support for surfaces and textures. It only appeared in LLVM 11, so we'd either have to backport that as well or re-implement the fix(es) in terms of what is currently there. Moreover, I'm not sure if Clang already knows how to register relocatable `__device__` functions and `extern __constant__` variables or that it needs to invoke `nvlink` to produce an uploadable GPU binary. I didn't implement support for that back then, and I couldn't find in the history that somebody reverse engineered the magic since then.

I agree that it's not clear how meaningful `weightError` is for RooDataSet, but still the only two classes that derive from RooAbsData are RooDataHist and RooDataSet.

We try to bring the behavior of the `RooAbsCollection`s closer to the STL containers like [std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). This means that `operator[]` should simply access an element as quickly as possible without any bounds checking for no overhead. That's why it changed from 6.24 to master. Only the `at()` member should do the bounds checking. I still have some work to do here because its behavior is inconsistent with `std::vector` (it returns a `nullptr` if the bounds check fails). So bringing the element-accessing behavior closer to Python behavior would unfortunately bring us further away from the STL behavior, and I would advise against the suggested change. However, I would agree that on the pyROOT side, the `RooAbsCollections` should behave more pythonic and we should absolutely implement a pythonization to support element access from the back with negative indices!

Looking at the following lines it would seem the only way it can happen is if the iterator is incremented ~~twice~~ before being dereferenced the first time? So e.g. in C++ the increment happens at the _end_ of the first iteration and in Python it happens at the beginning? https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/ae8bfc71975bf1801e32ccad46eb3f2bc14f03b2/tree/treeplayer/inc/TTreeReader.h#L93-L116",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8183
