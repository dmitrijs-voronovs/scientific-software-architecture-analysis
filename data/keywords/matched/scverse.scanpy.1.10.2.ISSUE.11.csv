https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/1127:909,energy efficiency,current,current,909,"[WIP] Dotplot (aka bubble plot) improvements; This PR addresses issues from #562 #1103. Here is a list of changes for `sc.pl.dotplot` and also for `sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot`:. * Colorbar and dot size legends had been improved. Now is also possible to set a title for them. * The dotplot functionality has been separated from the main function. This allows to take any two pandas dataFrames, one containing the color values and other containing the size to be plotted. * A new dotplot style is added, in which a background square is colored according to the colormap instead of the dot. The style can be chosen as parameter. * Now p-values, score and in general any parameter from `sc.rank_genes_groups` can be plotted. * `swap_axes` has been added. * **update**: method chaining was added to avoid explosion of parameters as suggested in #956.

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/1127:760,security,updat,update,760,"[WIP] Dotplot (aka bubble plot) improvements; This PR addresses issues from #562 #1103. Here is a list of changes for `sc.pl.dotplot` and also for `sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot`:. * Colorbar and dot size legends had been improved. Now is also possible to set a title for them. * The dotplot functionality has been separated from the main function. This allows to take any two pandas dataFrames, one containing the color values and other containing the size to be plotted. * A new dotplot style is added, in which a background square is colored according to the colormap instead of the dot. The style can be chosen as parameter. * Now p-values, score and in general any parameter from `sc.rank_genes_groups` can be plotted. * `swap_axes` has been added. * **update**: method chaining was added to avoid explosion of parameters as suggested in #956.
