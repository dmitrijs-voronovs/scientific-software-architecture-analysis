So far as I can understand I didn't produce the BAM file with the quality scores in step (1), but I don't know how to do that. I've looked at the [blasr](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/blasr) repository but didn't find something that describes how to do that. I would very appreciate if you can help me understand how to do that, or what do I need to search to find a a solution.

I've used blasr to align the BAM file of chr20 (the file generated from `samtools view -h sorted_final_merged.bam chr20 -o chr20.bam`) and the reference `chr20.fa`. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ blasr chr20.bam chr20.fa --bam --out alignments20.bam`. This command ran for about 13.5 hours on my local machine, and produced a file with size of 6.3GB, while the original `chr20.bam` file size was only 2.3GB . 2. I've sorted the produced alignments20.bam file using the samtools. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ samtools sort -f alignments20.bam alignments20_sorted.bam`. This command produced a sorted file with size of 7.75GB. 3. I tried running the `make_examples` script again with the new `alignments20_sorted.bam` file. The command:. ```. python bin/make_examples.zip \. --mode training \. --ref ""data/chr20.fa"" \. --reads ""data/alignments20_sorted.bam"" \. --examples ""training-examples/training_set.with_label.tfrecord.gz"" \. --confident_regions ""data/NA12878.sorted.bed"" \. --truth_variants ""data/NA12878.sorted.vcf.gz"" \. --regions ""chr20"" \. --norealign_reads. ```.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/138:23,security,updat,update,23,"@gunjanbaid @pgrosu an update:. 1. I've used blasr to align the BAM file of chr20 (the file generated from `samtools view -h sorted_final_merged.bam chr20 -o chr20.bam`) and the reference `chr20.fa`. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ blasr chr20.bam chr20.fa --bam --out alignments20.bam`. This command ran for about 13.5 hours on my local machine, and produced a file with size of 6.3GB, while the original `chr20.bam` file size was only 2.3GB . 2. I've sorted the produced alignments20.bam file using the samtools. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ samtools sort -f alignments20.bam alignments20_sorted.bam`. This command produced a sorted file with size of 7.75GB. 3. I tried running the `make_examples` script again with the new `alignments20_sorted.bam` file. The command:. ```. python bin/make_examples.zip \. --mode training \. --ref ""data/chr20.fa"" \. --reads ""data/alignments20_sorted.bam"" \. --examples ""training-examples/training_set.with_label.tfrecord.gz"" \. --confident_regions ""data/NA12878.sorted.bed"" \. --truth_variants ""data/NA12878.sorted.vcf.gz"" \. --regions ""chr20"" \. --norealign_reads. ```. And The output: (receiving the same QUAL field missing error). ```. 2019-01-29 11:46:16.329383: W third_party/nucleus/io/sam_reader.cc:125] Unknown tag pb: in header line, ignoring: @HD VN:1.5 SO:coordinate pb:3.0.1. 2019-01-29 11:46:16.333216: W third_party/nucleus/io/sam_reader.cc:531] Unrecognized SAM header type, ignoring:.

I've used blasr to align the BAM file of chr20 (the file generated from `samtools view -h sorted_final_merged.bam chr20 -o chr20.bam`) and the reference `chr20.fa`. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ blasr chr20.bam chr20.fa --bam --out alignments20.bam`. This command ran for about 13.5 hours on my local machine, and produced a file with size of 6.3GB, while the original `chr20.bam` file size was only 2.3GB . 2. I've sorted the produced alignments20.bam file using the samtools. The command:. `user@deepvariant:~/data$ samtools sort -f alignments20.bam alignments20_sorted.bam`. This command produced a sorted file with size of 7.75GB. 3. I tried running the `make_examples` script again with the new `alignments20_sorted.bam` file.

As a project, I need is to select a reference (doesn't really matter of what) and a dataset of long reads of that reference, successfully train the DeepVariant model with that set, and then evaluate the the trained model accuracy for the long reads. All I need to do is to use the data to make sets of training examples, validation examples and test examples, train the model with the training set, evaluate each checkpoint with the validation set, eventually choose the best checkpoint and finally evaluate it with the test set. Very similar to this [case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-tpu-training-case-study.md) DeepVariant provided, but with a dataset of long reads. Also thank you very much for pointing out that DeepVariant was not trained for non-CCS reads, I'll try using the dataset you provided! If I'll succeed training and evaluating the model with this dataset, it would help a lot to be able to compare my my final model to your trained model. Also if you can explain a little about how to work with the files in the dataset. Where can I find truth variants and confident regions file of it's reference for my training?
