I implemented almost everything you requested in the new fixup commits, except for two things:. 1. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930: I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where? 2. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053: I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. 3. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-890998817: I stuck with the detection of `dynamic_cast` vs. `static_cast` at compile time to also support non-polymorphic types.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8828:244,interoperability,conflict,conflicting,244,"@etejedor and me finally figured out what's the difference between the builds: The problem only arises if building with C++14 which pulls in `ROOT/RNotFn.hxx`, defining `std::Detail`. Because of the implicit `using namespace std;` this ends up conflicting with `namespace Detail` defined in the `root` prompt. FWIW here's the full `backtrace` from a Debug build (which gives less information by default compared to Release because of `assert`s?!):. ```. #0 0x00007ffff648c37f in raise () from /lib64/libc.so.6. #1 0x00007ffff6476db5 in abort () from /lib64/libc.so.6. #2 0x00007ffff6476c89 in __assert_fail_base.cold.0 () from /lib64/libc.so.6. #3 0x00007ffff6484a76 in __assert_fail () from /lib64/libc.so.6. #4 0x00007fffec1c4bb1 in llvm::isa_impl_cl<clang::TagType, clang::Type const*>::doit (Val=0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:105. #5 0x00007fffec1c296e in llvm::isa_impl_wrap<clang::TagType, clang::Type const*, clang::Type const*>::doit (Val=@0x7fffffffaa08: 0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:132. #6 0x00007fffec1bf2ff in llvm::isa_impl_wrap<clang::TagType, clang::Type const* const, clang::Type const*>::doit (Val=@0x7fffffffaa48: 0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:123. #7 0x00007fffec1ba2ee in llvm::isa<clang::TagType, clang::Type const*> (Val=@0x7fffffffaa48: 0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:143. #8 0x00007fffec1b56b5 in llvm::dyn_cast<clang::TagType, clang::Type const> (Val=0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/include/llvm/Support/Casting.h:343. #9 0x00007fffec44dae0 in clang::Type::getAs<clang::TagType> (this=0x0) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/include/clang/AST/Type.h:6858. #10 0x00007fffec46bf1c in TClingClassInfo::Init (this=0x1933310, tag=...) at /home/jhahnfel/ROOT/src/core/metacling/src/TClingClassInfo.cxx:775. #11 0x00007",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8828

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8828:435,testability,assert,assert,435,"@etejedor and me finally figured out what's the difference between the builds: The problem only arises if building with C++14 which pulls in `ROOT/RNotFn.hxx`, defining `std::Detail`. Because of the implicit `using namespace std;` this ends up conflicting with `namespace Detail` defined in the `root` prompt.

I think this PR implements now all the functionality requested by @will-cern in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8123, so it would be good if you Will could confirm this. In a later PR, I'm then going to implement what was not required to solve the issue but what is still useful for ROOT nonetheless (also mentioned in the PR description):. 1. make it possible to specify the global observables when generating a dataset:. `model.generate(x, 1000, GlobalObservables(g))`. 2. make it possible to also sample global observable values when generating a toy dataset:. `model.generate({x, g}, 1000, GlobalObservables(g))`. 3. Add a tutorial to show all the new functionality related to global observables",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8878

The simplest solution is to call `print(df.Describe())` to format properly the string. ""Fixing"" the desired output would change the existing usage of `Describe()` - returned type change from string to void and printing inside of the Describe. This is what is going on:. ```python. def foo(): # returns string. return ""a\nb"". def bar(): # void. print(""a\nb""). foo() # this is our case, giving excplicitly ""a\nb"". bar() # this is good. print(foo()) # this is good. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8893
