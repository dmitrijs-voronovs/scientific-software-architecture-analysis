The sequences are high quality and so will not be pruned for quality, but I wish to trim the first 6 bases. The trimming works correctly when only global trimming is on (`-f 6`; six bases are removed), and it works correctly when only quality pruning is on (`-5 -3`; no bases are removed), but it is incorrect when both are turned on (`-f 6 -5 -3`; *nine bases are removed*). . ```bash. cat <<EOT > /tmp/test.fastq. @NB502016:186:H2HNLBGXN:1:11101:4872:1081 1:N:0:0.

I was running .fastq files of DNA sequenced on our Nanopore through fastp (Nanopore says to use average read q-scores), and way more reads were passing the quality filter than I was used to. I looked into it, and fastp was averaging the q-scores, which are log values, and not taking the q-score out of log scale to p values before averaging. This results in way more reads passing the filter than there should be. As an example: . .

Because of the chemistry involved, our maximum read length is 167 nucleotides. If I set the length limit to 141 nucleotides or shorter, the program behaves as expected, returning only reads shorter than or equal to 141 nucleotides. Once we filter for 142 nucleotides or longer, the entirety of the fastq files are returned with no length filtering at all. The magic number seems to be 25. If the length is specified is within 25 nucleotides of the maximum read length, it will return all reads. 1) When in the process will fastp be filtering for read length? (I'm assuming after UMI removal and adapter cleaving, but I'd like to confirm that. Please note: we are not trimming the read length, we are filtering for a maximum read length, and I could not find when that occurs specified in the documentation.). 2) We use Illumina MiSeq adapters (which we specify the sequence for), which are 33 nucleotides long, and an 8 nucleotide long UMI. 33 - 8 = 25, So I'm wondering if the UMI removal and adapter cleaving have anything to do with the length limit problem, and if anyone has any insight into this.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/pull/533:764,usability,statu,status,764,"check read errors in fastqreader; It turns out, if there is a read error while reading a fastq, fastp will loop infinitely. Per cpp [fread docs](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/#return), it looks like the caller should check both `feof` and `ferror`. Because `ferror` wasn't checked, fastp went right back to `readToBuf` and looped infinitely. The issue is really hard to reproduce because you need an unreliable filesystem. While complicated, thankfully I could rerun in our own environment and reliably reproduce, but not in a way I can easily post here. Anyway, here are the logs I saw after fixing:. ```. reading fastq failed: Transport endpoint is not connected. Failed reading: sg_9.fastq. ```. And I saw:. ```.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/580:21,performance,failur,failure,21,"Deduplication issue: failure of one round deduplication + accuracy level issue. [fastp v0.23.4]; Hi, there. We tried to use fastp to do de-duplication. However, we found 2 issues. Looking forward to your reply. . 1) one round of de-duplication is ineffective. . we ran level 1 de-duplication and got ""Duplication rate: 0.498141%"". When we ran level 6 de-duplication on the input, we got ""Duplication rate: 0.312492%"". However, if we ran second round of de-duplication based on the output of first run. The Duplication rate can almost reach < 0.1%, see as below. . But. 2) accuracy level issue:. we run level 1 de-duplication first and then using the output to run de-duplication at different accuracy levels. . As you can see, level 1 + level 1 -> 0.00744113%, level 1 + level 3 -> 0.088817% , level 1 + level 6 -> 0.0237203%, which doesn't make sense. .
