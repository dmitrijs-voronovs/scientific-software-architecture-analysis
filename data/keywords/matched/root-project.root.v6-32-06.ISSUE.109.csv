https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15774:47,deployability,releas,release,47,"[ci] Add Python version to Windows precomplied release title or filename; ### Explain what you would like to see improved and how. When installing ROOT in Windows from precompiled release section [on the web](https://root.cern/releases/release-63200/), it's said that one has to use the same Visual Studio and Python version in the system than the one used for compiling. The Visual Studio version (2022) is part of the title and (vc17) is part of the filename. The same is not true for the Python version. It would be great if this could be added. For example, what Python version should be downloaded for v6.32.00 ? It's 3.11 but you need to find it out the hard way. Thanks in advance!! ### ROOT version. ```. ROOT v6.32.00.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15818:158,availability,failur,failure,158,"asan segfault due to declaration of function with very long return expression; ### Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. The failure seen in the asan job for the `gtest-tree-dataframe-test-dataframe-interface` test is due to the reproducer attached. It seems trying to JIT a function with a very long return expression is causing issues. Unfortunately asan just reports a segfault with no stacktrace, but I was able to get a (very long) stacktrace with gdb and the reproducer, see the attachment. Note that the reproducer is completely detached from RDataFrame and just calls the interpreter.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15887:294,availability,down,down,294,"Broken plot .C macros for default Name() argument in plotOn(); ### Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Dear experts,. I noticed that sometimes, when trying to produce .C macros for my figures, the `SaveAs()` function would return broken macros. I narrowed it down to the `Name()` arguments passed to the `plotOn()` function when plotting RooFit pdf's. The problem seems to be that the default `Name()` value contains special characters (`[` and `]`, in this case), and these characters end up in variable names in the .C macro. I have included a reproducer below (`test_plot_macros.cpp`) which produces three .C macros, two of which are broken as described above. For instance, in `plot1.C` (one of the produced macros), one can find invalid code such as . ```cpp. Double_t pdf_Norm[x]_fx1[114] = {. -10.2002,. -10.2,. ... ```. Would it be possible to filter these special characters when producing the macros? ### Reproducer. Create a file `test_plot_macros.cpp` containing the script below and run `root test_plot_macros.cpp`. ```cpp. #include ""TCanvas.h"". #include ""RooArgSet.h"". #include ""RooDataSet.h"". #include ""RooGaussian.h"". #include ""RooPlot.h"". #include ""RooRealVar.h"". using namespace RooFit;. void test_plot_macros() {. // Create a PDF. RooRealVar x(""x"", ""x"", -10, 10);. RooRealVar mean(""mean"", ""mean"", 0, -10, 10);. RooRealVar width(""width"", ""width"", 2, 0, 5);. RooGaussian gaus(""pdf"", ""pdf"", x, mean, width);. // Generate some data. RooDataSet* data = gaus.generate(RooArgSet(x), Name(""data""), NumEvents(2000));. // Plots.

Dear experts,. I noticed that sometimes, when trying to produce .C macros for my figures, the `SaveAs()` function would return broken macros. I narrowed it down to the `Name()` arguments passed to the `plotOn()` function when plotting RooFit pdf's. The problem seems to be that the default `Name()` value contains special characters (`[` and `]`, in this case), and these characters end up in variable names in the .C macro. I have included a reproducer below (`test_plot_macros.cpp`) which produces three .C macros, two of which are broken as described above. For instance, in `plot1.C` (one of the produced macros), one can find invalid code such as . ```cpp. Double_t pdf_Norm[x]_fx1[114] = {. -10.2002,. -10.2,. ... ```.
