https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7055:1110,reliability,fail,fail,1110,"oot/pull/6385 as there are too many bot comments in that PR. cc @vgvassilev. When testing the LLVM 9 PR for conda-forge and had a few issues with external LLVM/Clang/Cling so I temporarily switched to the builtins. This works from the build directory but it then has issues once `make install` is ran. More details are in the comment copied at the end of this issue. I think this is an issue with root's install commands rather than the conda-recipe, but you can reproduce what I'm doing it docker by running:. ```bash. git clone https://github.com/chrisburr/root-feedstock.git. cd root-feedstock. git checkout llvm90-install-error. # Adjust CPU_COUNT as required. CPU_COUNT=192 ./build-locally.py --debug --output-id '*root_base*' linux_64_numpy1.16python3.8.____cpython. # When the container launches, look at the output and run the suggested command. # which will be of the form:. cd xxxxx && source xxxxx/build_env_setup.sh. source $RECIPE_DIR/build_root-base.sh. # Anything with ROOT will now fail, e.g. root. # Rather than waiting to build again, you can roll back to before. # ""make install"" was ran by running. cd ../.. rm -rf $PWD/*. cp -rp $PWD.bak/* $PWD/. cd -. ```. >The command I'm running was simply `root` to get the interactive prompt. The full output of trying to run `1+2` is below:. >```log. >$ root -b -q -x -e 1+2. >input_line_1:1:2: fatal error: module 'libc' imported by AST file '/home/cburr/mambaforge/conda-bld/root_1609268594446/_h_env_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placeh/lib/std.pcm' found in a different module map file (/home/cburr/mambaforge/conda-bld/root_1609268594446/_h_env_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placeh/etc/cling/libc.modulemap) than w",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7055

I think this is an issue with root's install commands rather than the conda-recipe, but you can reproduce what I'm doing it docker by running:. ```bash. git clone https://github.com/chrisburr/root-feedstock.git. cd root-feedstock. git checkout llvm90-install-error. # Adjust CPU_COUNT as required. CPU_COUNT=192 ./build-locally.py --debug --output-id '*root_base*' linux_64_numpy1.16python3.8.____cpython. # When the container launches, look at the output and run the suggested command. # which will be of the form:. cd xxxxx && source xxxxx/build_env_setup.sh. source $RECIPE_DIR/build_root-base.sh. # Anything with ROOT will now fail, e.g. root. # Rather than waiting to build again, you can roll back to before. # ""make install"" was ran by running. cd ../.. rm -rf $PWD/*. cp -rp $PWD.bak/* $PWD/. cd -. ```. >The command I'm running was simply `root` to get the interactive prompt.

Gaussian.graphVizTree(""tree_example.dot"");. GaussianWithSpace.graphVizTree(""tree_example2.dot""); // Produces invalid output. }. ```. Then attempt to convert the produced `.dot` files to images using. `dot -Tpng tree_example.dot -o example1.png # Produces an image`. `dot -Tpng tree_example2.dot -o example2.png # Error!`. The first of these will produce a .png image, the second will fail with a message like: `Error: tree_example2.dot: syntax error in line 1 near 'gaussian'`. Can be fixed by enclosing the graph title in quotes: i.e. changing line 1 of `tree_example2.dot` from. `digraph my gaussian{`. to. `digraph ""my gaussian""{`. ### Setup. <!--. 1. ROOT version. 2.

At the moment, the `ROOT::TLorentzVector` class uses a pseudorapidity-based calculation for the commonly-used DeltaR distance between vectors.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7112:829,deployability,log,logic,829,"How to access RNTuple in a BulkIO style; _This PR is not intended to be merged into ROOT! That's why it's a draft!_. The purpose of this PR is to show which private members I had to make public to access RNTuple in a BulkIO style. Two of these changes were just to parameterize the cluster and page sizes:. * `fClusterSizeEntries` was made public so that I could set it and make it apples-to-apples with the other formats. * `kDefaultElementsPerPage = 2097152` is large, but 8× less than the maximum size that can be compressed. The maximum is `0xffffff` because the header provides 3 bytes to specify the uncompressed size, so that uncompressed size can't exceed that. The number I chose here is `2**21`, which is 8× below that limit, to allow for 8-byte integers and floating point numbers. What's probably missing here is the logic for splitting the data to be compressed into a series of blocks with this maximum size. (TTree and normal serialized objects do that.). The rest of the changes are just turning private/protected members into public ones so that they can be read directly in a BulkIO style.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7115:86,modifiability,version,version,86,"[RF] regex_error when selecting pdf components to plot; I’ve recently updated my ROOT version to v6.20.06 and my once working code snippet to plot several pdf components on the same canvas broke. No matter if I select the pdf components by object reference or by name, i.e. by:. ```. modelTot.plotOn(frame, RooFit::Components(“ modelBkgTotTrig*”),. FillColor(93), LineColor(93), DrawOption(“F”));. ```. or by:. ```. modelTot.plotOn(frame, RooFit::Components(RooArgSet(expo)),. FillColor(93), LineColor(93), DrawOption(“F”));. ```. I get:. ```. [#1] INFO:Plotting -- RooAbsPdf::plotOn(modelTot0) directly selected PDF components: (modelBkgTotTrig0). [#1] INFO:Plotting -- RooAbsPdf::plotOn(modelTot0) indirectly selected PDF components: (). terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::regex_error'. what(): Unexpected character in brace expression. Aborted (core dumped). ```. It looks like they are found but then the regex_error appears. Is this a known issure or shall I do something different to select the pdfs to plot? Thanks,.
