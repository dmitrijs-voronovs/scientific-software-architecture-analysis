Am I right in saying that `en_ner_bionlp13cg_md` predicts these 16 labels (just with different names)? #### Second possible list of labels. However, if we run `spacy.load(""en_ner_bionlp13cg_md"").entity.labels` we get the following 17 labels. 1. AMINO_ACID. 2. ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM. 3. CANCER. 4. CELL. 5. CELLULAR_COMPONENT. 6.

PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION. 16. SIMPLE_CHEMICAL. 17. TISSUE. This second list looks wrong to me. Indeed, after running the model on a few texts, I found out that the model actually never predicted `MULTI` or `TISSUE` labels (which however appear in the list), but did instead predict `MULTI-TISSUE_STRUCTURE` (which does not appear in the list!). How is this possible? If `ner.entity.labels` is wrong, how can the predicted annotations be right? Am I missing something? #### Third possible list of labels. Finally, the list of entity types mentioned in the [scispacy docs|https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/] also look wrong to me. It mentions 14 labels:. 1. AMINO_ACID. 2. ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM. 3.

Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity. TUI(s): T116, T121, T129.
