We should, at least, take care of the following changes in class definitions:. - Addition of a data member. - Removal of a data member. - An existing member changes its datatype. Also, we should support some form of manual schema evolution (similar to the existing I/O rules in ROOT).

Applications may do something like:. ```cpp. TRint *app = new TRint(""app"", 0, NULL);. ... app->Run(kTRUE);. ```. Applications may also use `TRint` during operation. One existing model some applications I use are employing is:. * Create a `TRint` shortly after startup, passing in `argc` and `argv`. . * Allow the user to drop to a ROOT interpreter prompt. This is then done by calling `app->Run(kTRUE);`. A user can use the interpreter to inspect state of the analysis software, and exit it again to let the software continue. . The latter approach is extremely useful for example to shell out after analysis software startup, or inside an event, such that the user can interactively analyze objects right from a ROOT interpreter shell. . ### Questions. * Is the use case ""use TRint as class to drop into the interpreter"" supported? .

The changelog of 6.26.00 reads like `TRint` is meant for internal use by `root.exe` only, but there seems to be no easy alternative. . Depending on the reply, this could be a separate bug report, or a ""wontfix"". . * If the use case is / should be supported, It would be useful to be able to allow unsupported arguments to pass through, for use in applications which are not `root.exe`. . * For improved backwards compatibility and safety, not crashing when being passed `*argc = nullptr` and / or `argv = nullptr` would be nice. . In case somebody else is hit by this, I am right now using this hack as workaround:. ```cpp. int dargc = 1;. char** dargv = &argv[0];. myApp = new TRint(""myApp"", &dargc, dargv, nullptr, 0, kTRUE);. myApp->GetOptions(&argc, (argv));. gSystem->SetProgname(argv[0]);. ```.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10090:1641,usability,support,supported,1641,"hard for unknown arguments. . * `TRint` crashes when instantiated with `*argc = nullptr` and / or `argv = nullptr` which are the default values for `TApplication` and hence may be used by existing users of the `TRint` constructor. . ### Affected use cases. Applications may do something like:. ```cpp. TRint *app = new TRint(""app"", 0, NULL);. ... app->Run(kTRUE);. ```. Applications may also use `TRint` during operation. One existing model some applications I use are employing is:. * Create a `TRint` shortly after startup, passing in `argc` and `argv`. . * Allow the user to drop to a ROOT interpreter prompt. This is then done by calling `app->Run(kTRUE);`. A user can use the interpreter to inspect state of the analysis software, and exit it again to let the software continue. . The latter approach is extremely useful for example to shell out after analysis software startup, or inside an event, such that the user can interactively analyze objects right from a ROOT interpreter shell. . ### Questions. * Is the use case ""use TRint as class to drop into the interpreter"" supported? .

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10101:1263,energy efficiency,Draw,Draw,1263,"ng I didn't implement was checking if the different ranges overlapped at all. If several of the ranges are overlapping (i.e. [0,50], [25, 75]), then at present the bins in both regions will be added twice, not sure what sort of behavior this would cause. I think the best way to get around that is to check when the range are added, I note that one such check is already in place in [`DataRange::CleanRangeSet`](https://root.cern/root/html606/DataRange_8cxx_source.html#l00165), this could be extended.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10101:493,usability,behavi,behavior,493,"Allow multiple ranges in HFitInterface::FillData; # This Pull request:. Allows multiple (discontinuous) ranges for `HFitInterface::FillData`, see [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/fitting-one-function-to-multiple-ranges-simultaneously/49061/3). @lmoneta - one thing I didn't implement was checking if the different ranges overlapped at all. If several of the ranges are overlapping (i.e. [0,50], [25, 75]), then at present the bins in both regions will be added twice, not sure what sort of behavior this would cause. I think the best way to get around that is to check when the range are added, I note that one such check is already in place in [`DataRange::CleanRangeSet`](https://root.cern/root/html606/DataRange_8cxx_source.html#l00165), this could be extended. Wanted to flag with you first before I changed too much though. Example for 1D use:. ```. TF1 *back = new TF1(""back"", ""[0] + x*[1]"", -10, 10);.
