Moreover the exit code is 0, which typically means successful completion of a process. When merging multiple sets of files it is possible to miss the printed messages. I don't know of any way of automating the process of detecting the issues. ### Describe the solution you'd like. I believe the operation would be much more robust if. 1. hadd produced no output file if any issues with the input files are encountered, except when option `-k` is provided explicitly. 2. hadd generates exit code different from 0 if any issues with input files are encountered. ### Describe alternatives you've considered. Alternative solution is of course avoiding the errors to occur and checking for them separately. ### Additional context.

The changes introduced in PR #7616 have the side effect of breaking existing use of the RooNLLVar constructor where it is specified that the PDF is extended but the defaults for all further arguments are accepted, e.g. `nllVar_ = new RooNLLVar(""nllVar"", """", model_, *exptData_, extended_);`. where `model_` is a `RooAddPdf`, `exptData_` is a `RooDataSet*` and `extended_` is a `bool`.

I think this should restore backward compatibility in this scenario. ### To Reproduce. <!--. Steps to reproduce the behavior:. 1.

In a local jupyter notebook and SWAN, the output of a code block only shows after the block finishes execution. This makes progress bars only display after completion, rendering them useless. ### Expected behavior. An std::flush should update the output of a code block of a notebook, even if the code block is still running. ### To Reproduce. For example:. ```. std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point begin = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();. for(long i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++). {. if(i % 100000000 == 0). {. std::cout << i << ""\n"" << std::flush;. }. }. std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();. std::cout << ""Time difference = "" << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - begin).count() << ""ms\n"";. ```. This takes 7 seconds on my machine, thus long enough to see the numbers pop up sequentially in a ROOT console. However, in a local notebook or on SWAN, all of the output is only shown after 7 seconds. ### Setup. ROOT version: ROOT 6.24/06. Operating system: Ubuntu on windows (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS). How you obtained ROOT: Downloaded today via Conda. Jupyter Notebook 6.4.3 (ROOT kernel). ### Additional context. On Swan, progress bars work on SWAN software stack 97a, but not on 99 and 100.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8989

The HistFactory xml specification allows for editing constraint terms of nuisance parameters in the measurement with constructions like:. ```xml. <ConstraintTerm Type=""Uniform"" RelativeUncertainty=""1"">NP_norm</ConstraintTerm>. ```. Constraint terms can be removed from `OverallSys` modifiers, but the same method does not seem to work for `HistoSys` modifiers (and the setting seems to be silently ignored). Constraint term ""removal"" can be achieved by changing the constraint term to be uniform, but `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement::AddNoSyst` also provides an alternative method. The xml created from that seems to be incompatible with `hist2workspace`, as the xml uses `NoSyst` and `hist2workspace` seems to (at least parse) `NoConstraint` instead, but crashes for `NoSyst`. ### Expected behavior. I expect constraint term editing to work for both `OverallSys` and `HistoSys` modifiers. Both approaches of changing the constraint term to be uniform and removing it completely should work with `hist2workspace`. . ### To Reproduce.

The HistFactory xml specification allows for editing constraint terms of nuisance parameters in the measurement with constructions like:. ```xml. <ConstraintTerm Type=""Uniform"" RelativeUncertainty=""1"">NP_norm</ConstraintTerm>. ```. Constraint terms can be removed from `OverallSys` modifiers, but the same method does not seem to work for `HistoSys` modifiers (and the setting seems to be silently ignored). Constraint term ""removal"" can be achieved by changing the constraint term to be uniform, but `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement::AddNoSyst` also provides an alternative method. The xml created from that seems to be incompatible with `hist2workspace`, as the xml uses `NoSyst` and `hist2workspace` seems to (at least parse) `NoConstraint` instead, but crashes for `NoSyst`. ### Expected behavior. I expect constraint term editing to work for both `OverallSys` and `HistoSys` modifiers. Both approaches of changing the constraint term to be uniform and removing it completely should work with `hist2workspace`. . ### To Reproduce.

(or it supports them differently?). . ### Expected behavior. `auto f = TFile::Open(""https://user:p\\@ssword@example.org/lotterynumbers.root"")` should work regardless of if DaviX is installed or not, as `auto f = TFile::Open(""https://user:password@example.org/lotterynumbers.root"")` does. . ### To Reproduce. Try to access a file hidden behind http basic authentication using TFile::Open with and without DaviX where the password contains an @. Without DaviX installed, TFile::Open( ) delegates to TWebFile and it works. With DaviX, DaviX tries to handle it but it doesn't support basic auth. . ### Setup. root 6.24/04 on Fedora 34 (x86-64) installed via dnf, with and without root-net-davix. . ### Additional context. Note that there is some functionality supported by DaviX not supported by TWebFile (see e.g. #8890), so delegating to TWebFile is not necessarily the right solution. Probably better have Davix do the same TUrl parsing of passwords, so that escaping @ remains the same.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9072

I expect this to just compile. I believe the problem may lie with the PyTorch version I had installed, 1.7.0. CMake should detect the version and disable incompatible tests. Indeed, installing PyTorch 1.9.1 makes the problem go away. ### To Reproduce. Install PyTorch 1.7.0 with conda or pip, make sure it's in your PATH so CMake detects it, and build the `SofieCompileModels_PyTorch` target. ### Setup. 1. ROOT version: master. 2.

Origin of the issue is from the forum discussion [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/error-in-tcollectionlessstlreader-getcp-read-error-in-tbranchproxy/47178). During the event loop over the friend `TTree` with `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` enabled using `RDataFrame` at some point, many errors pop up:. `Error in <TCollectionLessSTLReader::GetCP()>: Read error in TBranchProxy.`. I couldn't reproduce this behavior with manually produced fresh root files, so I assume something might have gone wrong with a root file itself during the creation.. However, without using ""Friend"" `TTree` or with `TTree` with `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` disabled, the file is analized correctly without any errors. This makes me wonder is this is a bug, or what is an explanation for such a behavior? ### Expected behavior. No errors should appear... ### To Reproduce. Run following code snippet:. ```. import ROOT. # Commenting MT line makes this example work.

ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(). ch = ROOT.TChain(""lumical""). ch.Add(""test_default.root""). ch.AddFriend(""emv=lumical"", ""test_emv.root""). # Adding test_emv.root as the only one but not as a friend, also works... # ch = ROOT.TChain(""lumical""). # ch.Add(""test_emv.root""). h_emv = ROOT.RDataFrame(ch).Filter(""if (rdfentry_ % 500000 == 0){cout<<rdfentry_<<endl;} return true;"")\. .Histo1D((""h_emv"", ""emv"", 100, -100, 100), ""emv.mc_cont_posy"" ). h_emv.Draw(). input(""wait""). ```. The links for the root files:. https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/s/2Lf6469S22sYt3T. ### Setup. Tested with:. `source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_100rc2/x86_64-centos7-gcc10-opt/setup.sh`. 1. ROOT version 6.24/00. 2. Operating system Centos7. 3. Python 3.8.6. ### Additional context. After stopping and killing the job which produces errors above, restarting the script can sometimes produce following error:. `Error in <TTreeRea",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9106

Origin of the issue is from the forum discussion [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/error-in-tcollectionlessstlreader-getcp-read-error-in-tbranchproxy/47178). During the event loop over the friend `TTree` with `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` enabled using `RDataFrame` at some point, many errors pop up:. `Error in <TCollectionLessSTLReader::GetCP()>: Read error in TBranchProxy.`. I couldn't reproduce this behavior with manually produced fresh root files, so I assume something might have gone wrong with a root file itself during the creation.. However, without using ""Friend"" `TTree` or with `TTree` with `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` disabled, the file is analized correctly without any errors.
