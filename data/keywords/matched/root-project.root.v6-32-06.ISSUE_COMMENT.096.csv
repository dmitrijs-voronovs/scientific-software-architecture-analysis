A small benefit is that we need to checksum fewer bytes. I think that checksumming of the underlying storage layer will be hard to reuse in a meaningful way because most likely the checksummed byte ranges do not align with RNTuple structures (page, page group or similar). So what the underlying storage layer does is fine, and maybe the user decides that the storage layer is so reliable that one can skip application-level checksums altogether but I think that is as far as it goes. An advantage of checksumming uncompressed data is that they are stable when different encodings or compression algorithms are applied. I'm not sure though if we can exploit that anywhere.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15921

I considered it an error in the text but missed to explicitly mention it. My main reason to checksum compressed data is that we can verify data integrity without decompressing the data.

I would also suggest adding an alternative way (commented) in the tutorial to ""zoom"" rather than ""setting user range"", namely to use:. ```. scatter->GetHistogram()->SetMinimum(10);. scatter->GetHistogram()->SetMaximum(200);. ```. This way, the palette is also zoomed, unlike with SetUserRange, which just acts as a filter on what points to plot or not. Also: there is a bug:. - If one calls SetMinimum only, then the plot is broken. If that's intended, then maybe we should create a function scatter->SetMinMax() so that people don't forget to put both. - the behavior of the TH2F when zooming Z-axis is different from TScatter. In TH2F, colors outside the range are clipped to max or min color. Here in TScatter, instead of clipping, they are filtered out of the plot.

If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16028:463,energy efficiency,scale,scaled,463,"Hi. few comments after digging a bit in the code... . - it looks the problem is not in the RooDataHist itself but it's in the plotOn function. If you check the RooDataHist content, bin content is equal to the original histogram. The problem looks coming from this line [0]: if you comment it then the plot looks good. - the plotting problem occurs also when you get a PDF from the RooDataHist using RooHistPdf. If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't. In this case I didn't find how to fix the problem (the RooHistPdf code is a lot more complicated than the RooDataHist routine) but checking the behaviour of the PDF (i.e fitting the PDF to the RooDataHist), everything looks ok both for the fixed and variable size histogram. See the attached modified version of the previous code to see the PDF begaviour mentioned above. Best. Attilio.

If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16087:957,usability,close,close,957,"`DistancetoPrimitive` is the base method to be overridden by visual primitives attached to the pad. In `geom` we attach several different objects. Among these, shapes implement this function directly, while for volumes there is some traversal logic in the geometry painter, dispatching eventually to the shapes methods. Composite Boolean shapes are special and need an extra internal specialized dispatching for union, intersection, and subtraction. The intention was to do this dispatching by avoiding the TObject interface (Boolean nodes are never added directly to the pad), and this is why the upper case `T`. However, due to the complexity, these functions are not implemented, so now they are not even connected to `TGeoCompositeShape::DistancetoPrimitive`. .

I think it's because you are trying to capture from Python an output which is printed from a C++ library (see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24277488/in-python-how-to-capture-the-stdout-from-a-c-shared-library-to-a-variable). I think the best option at the moment is really to have a report2string function if needed. E.g. (following the example of Dev). ```python. import ROOT. def Report2Str(report):. begin = report.begin(). if begin == report.end(): return """". allEntries = begin.GetAll(). result = """". for ci in report:. name = ci.GetName(). pass_val = ci.GetPass(). all = ci.GetAll(). eff = ci.GetEff(). cumulativeEff = 100.0 * float(pass_val) / float(allEntries) if allEntries > 0 else 0.0. result+=f""{name:10}: pass={pass_val:<10} all={all:<10} -- eff={eff:.2f} % cumulative eff={cumulativeEff:.2f} %"". return result. rdf = ROOT.RDataFrame(128). rdf = rdf.Define(""nMuon"", ""int(gRandom->Uniform(10.))""). rdf = rdf.Filter(""nMuon == 2"", ""2 muons""). rep = rdf.Report(). myStr = Report2Str(rep). ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16138
