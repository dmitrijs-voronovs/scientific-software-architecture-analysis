This PR contains a few hotfixes to the HS3 implementation. ## Changes or fixes:. - attempting to export a forbidden variable name now triggers an error message. - export-keys-based exporters now use RooAbsProxy instead of RooRealProxy to allow also non-function-type and non-list-type proxies to be exported successfully. - added a unit test for import and export of RooBernstein to cover the import/export issues for export-keys-based exporters. - invalid category names will now be fixed upon export such that they don't lead to invalid data names. - FlexibleInterpVars with unequal numbers of variables and high/low variations will now be cut-off on minimum length upon export. - HistFactory ShapeSys and staterror will now export and import the parameter names instead of auto-generating them. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally. - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

A valid question is why one would want to build ROOT inside a qemu/docker environment where a foreign architecture is emulated? Well, just for this PR in fact, to make it self-contained and (somewhat) debuggable. You can also build a container natively on ARM, upload to docker, and atempt to run ROOT inside that container on a qemu/docker arm64 emulation, with the same results. ## Still, why would you want to do that??? We have provided ARM containers for our users at the Electron-Ion Collider for a while now. In the absence of ARM nodes on our container build cluster, we build these using emulation. Aside from a rare major dependency recompile, this works well enough. As of ROOT v6.28 we have had to stop providing ARM images for our users because the C++20 feature of the upgrade was more important than the continued ARM support.

Linux Ubuntu 23.04. ### Additional context. ## Why would you want to do that??? A valid question is why one would want to build ROOT inside a qemu/docker environment where a foreign architecture is emulated? Well, just for this PR in fact, to make it self-contained and (somewhat) debuggable. You can also build a container natively on ARM, upload to docker, and atempt to run ROOT inside that container on a qemu/docker arm64 emulation, with the same results. ## Still, why would you want to do that??? We have provided ARM containers for our users at the Electron-Ion Collider for a while now. In the absence of ARM nodes on our container build cluster, we build these using emulation. Aside from a rare major dependency recompile, this works well enough. As of ROOT v6.28 we have had to stop providing ARM images for our users because the C++20 feature of the upgrade was more important than the continued ARM support.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13852:1131,usability,error,error,1131,"[math] Minuit2 errors out with `Initial matrix not pos.def.` depending on which histograms were fitted before; This is the underlying issue related to a CMSSW issue:. * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/42979. To reproduce, download this ROOT file with a single `TH2F`:. [histo.zip](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/12886644/histo.zip). And then fit a subset of the 1D slices:. ```c++. std::unique_ptr<TFile> file{TFile::Open(""histo.root"", ""READ"")};. auto hist = file->Get<TH2>(""dxyres_vs_eta"");. hist->FitSlicesY(nullptr, 10, 21, 0, ""QNR"");. ```. You will see a Minuit2 error:. ```txt. Error in <Minuit2>: VariableMetricBuilder Initial matrix not pos.def. ```. Note that this doesn't happen with the old Minuit, which you can select like this at the beginning of the script:. ```c++. ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit"", ""Migrad"");. ```. There is something weird going on, because this happens in the fit for bin 21, but it is necessary to fit all the slices 10 to 20 before. Otherwise there is no error.
