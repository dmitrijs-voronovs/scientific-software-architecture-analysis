I thought why not make these changes in this PR in a separate commit when I'm already reading and changing the files.

One TTree with 9 entries saved to one file, plus one TChain with 9 total entries, three files each with a TTree with 3 entries. In each scenario I will create the datasets, read the files back, add one of the two datasets as a friend to the other. Finally, I will try to print the columns both with `TTree::Print` and rdf's `Display`. Plus, I will also use `TTree::Scan` to get more information on the internal structure of the tree and its friend. # Case 1.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785:343,testability,simpl,simple,343,"Alright, thanks for all the details and clarifications. Let me try to bring this PR a conclusion. The original question was: is it right, at least for the usecases of the function `GetFriendInfo`, to retrieve the name of any friend chain via the following? ```. const auto *realName = chainFiles->First()->GetName();. ```. Let me try to make (simple) examples of tree/chain friends and how RDataFrame deals with them. Let's say my final goal is to have this dataset. | parent.x | friend.x |. |----------|----------|. | 0 | 0 |. | 1 | 1 |. | 2 | 2 |. | 3 | 3 |. | 4 | 4 |. | 5 | 5 |. | 6 | 6 |. | 7 | 7 |. | 8 | 8 |. I can do that through:. 1. Two TTrees, each with 9 entries, each saved to one single file. 2. Two TChains, each chain has 9 total entries, each chain is made of three files, each file has internally one TTree with 3 entries. 3. One TTree with 9 entries saved to one file, plus one TChain with 9 total entries, three files each with a TTree with 3 entries. In each scenario I will create the datasets, read the files back, add one of the two datasets as a friend to the other. Finally, I will try to print the columns both with `TTree::Print` and rdf's `Display`. Plus, I will also use `TTree::Scan` to get more information on the internal structure of the tree and its friend. # Case 1. This is the code I use to recreate the scenario. ```cpp. void write_tree(std::string_view filename, std::string_view treename). {. int x{};. TFile file{filename.data(), ""recreate""};. TTree tree{treename.data(), ""test friend trees""};. tree.Branch(""x"", &x, ""x/I"");. for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++). {. x = i;. tree.Fill();. }. tree.Write();. }. . int main(){. write_tree(""treeparent.root"", ""treeparent"");. write_tree(""treefriend.root"", ""treefriend"");.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785:343,usability,simpl,simple,343,"Alright, thanks for all the details and clarifications. Let me try to bring this PR a conclusion. The original question was: is it right, at least for the usecases of the function `GetFriendInfo`, to retrieve the name of any friend chain via the following? ```. const auto *realName = chainFiles->First()->GetName();. ```. Let me try to make (simple) examples of tree/chain friends and how RDataFrame deals with them. Let's say my final goal is to have this dataset. | parent.x | friend.x |. |----------|----------|. | 0 | 0 |. | 1 | 1 |. | 2 | 2 |. | 3 | 3 |. | 4 | 4 |. | 5 | 5 |. | 6 | 6 |. | 7 | 7 |. | 8 | 8 |. I can do that through:. 1. Two TTrees, each with 9 entries, each saved to one single file. 2. Two TChains, each chain has 9 total entries, each chain is made of three files, each file has internally one TTree with 3 entries. 3. One TTree with 9 entries saved to one file, plus one TChain with 9 total entries, three files each with a TTree with 3 entries. In each scenario I will create the datasets, read the files back, add one of the two datasets as a friend to the other. Finally, I will try to print the columns both with `TTree::Print` and rdf's `Display`. Plus, I will also use `TTree::Scan` to get more information on the internal structure of the tree and its friend. # Case 1. This is the code I use to recreate the scenario. ```cpp. void write_tree(std::string_view filename, std::string_view treename). {. int x{};. TFile file{filename.data(), ""recreate""};. TTree tree{treename.data(), ""test friend trees""};. tree.Branch(""x"", &x, ""x/I"");. for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++). {. x = i;. tree.Fill();. }. tree.Write();. }. . int main(){. write_tree(""treeparent.root"", ""treeparent"");. write_tree(""treefriend.root"", ""treefriend"");.

The `GetFriendInfo` function will return the name of the friend tree. ## Case 2 above. If the dataset is made of two TChains, one main and one friend, we have the following:. 1. TTree::Print(""all"") will always only print information of the main chain, not the friend one. 2. If the friend chain has a name, both TTree::Scan and RDataFrame Display can see the friend column correctly. This use case should be taken into account in `GetFriendInfo`, and it is since the name of the friend chain will always appear as the ""alias"" component of any element of `RFriendInfo::fFriendNames`. 3. If the friend chain has no name, TTree::Scan behaves inconsistently. I can do `Scan(""y:treefriend1.y"")` but then `Scan(""y:treefriend[23].y"")` will both fail. RDataFrame always prints an error, so for the sake of the `GetFriendInfo` function this is not a valid usecase (as also Enrico said). ## Case 3 above.
