Now one can fully remove `TVirtualX.h` from `TVirtualPad.h`, `TCanvas.h` and co. Also GUI classes do not require to populate `TVirtualX` interface via headers - . one can put `#include ""TVirtualX.h""` in sources where it really used.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5084:757,testability,test,tested,757,"[CMake] Correctly return real (safe) install paths at runtime; Currently when installed with `-Dgnuinstall=ON` ROOT ends up exporting relative paths from the `${CMAKE_INSTALL_CMAKEDIR}` to the relevant binary, include and library directories. This can be a problem, especially when these paths may be evaluated from a different system folder assumed by CMake (e.g. when `CMAKE_INTSTALL_CMAKEDIR` is not the same for ROOT and CMake) as well as in other cases, when relative paths are not appropriate. Thus, it is safer in the general case to have these relative paths resolved to absolute system paths immediately before being passed to a caller. This merge request tries to accomplish just that with complete transparency and zero side-effects. It has been tested and deployed in Arch Linux x86_64, CMake 3.16.4, GCC 9.2.1:. - resulting relevant CMake config:. ```cmake. #----------------------------------------------------------------------------. # Configure the path to the ROOT headers, using a relative path if possible. # This is only known at CMake time, so we expand a CMake supplied variable. #. # ROOT configured for the install with relative paths, so use these. get_filename_component(_ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS ""${_thisdir}/../../../include"" REALPATH). # resolve relative paths to absolute system paths. get_filename_component(ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS ""${_ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS}"" REALPATH). # ROOT configured for the install with relative paths, so use these. get_filename_component(_ROOT_LIBRARY_DIR ""${_thisdir}/../../root"" REALPATH). # resolve relative paths to absolute system paths. get_filename_component(ROOT_LIBRARY_DIR ""${_ROOT_LIBRARY_DIR}"" REALPATH). # ROOT configured for the install with relative paths, so use these. get_filename_component(_ROOT_BINDIR ""${_thisdir}/../../../bin"" REALPATH). # resolve relative paths to absolute system paths. get_filename_component(ROOT_BINDIR ""${_ROOT_BINDIR}"" REALPATH). # Deprecated value, please don't use it and use ROOT_BINDIR instead. get_filename_com",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5084

Purpose: HistFactory and RooWorkspace should be able to import and export their contents from and to text files, using a common JSON/YAML syntax. Method: The code has been written in such a way as to. - Minimize the amount of changes to existing code. - Make it as easy as possible for users to add new serializers/deserializers for new or existing classes. - Provide a clean interface as much as possible. Dependencies: The code requires a JSON/YML parser and emitter. ROOT already includes the nlohmann JSON module, which is used as a default for the interface. However, for development, I have been using the rapidyml package, which also supports reading and writing of YML files. As the code for this already exists, I have kept this in as an optional dependency. When available, it replaces the nlohmann interface and then also provides YML reading and writing capabilities, while the default is limited to JSON. Please review:. - general coding style. - packaging: Should these new files continue to live in RooStats, or should they go to a new subpackage of RooFit? - code placement: Is the way I split the functionality up into different source files acceptable, or would you wish for a smaller/higher granularity of the splitting? - build system: Is the way I encoded the optional dependency acceptable? - class and function names: Are the names of classes and functions acceptable, or should things be renamed to be more conformant?
