ROOT installed from the binary distribtution for Ubuntu 22 is broken and can't start, at least for 6.26.08 and 6.26.10 (N.B. this is using WSL2). ### Expected behavior. `root` should start normally. ### To Reproduce. - Install dependencies via `apt`. - N.B. `python` and `python-dev` do not exist on Ubuntu22; use `python3` and `python-is-python3` instead; likewise `libglew1.5-dev` should now be `libglew-dev`. - Download and unpack `root_v6.26.10.Linux-ubuntu22-x86_64-gcc11.3.tar.gz` in `/opt`. - `cd /opt/root; source bin/thisroot.sh`. - Then I get the following:. ```. ➜ which root. /opt/root/bin/root. ➜ root. input_line_1:1:2: fatal error: module file '/home/sftnight/build/ws/BUILDTYPE/Release/LABEL/ROOT-ubuntu2204/V/6-26/build/lib/libc.pcm' not found: module file not found. #include <new>. ^. input_line_1:1:2: note: imported by module 'std' in '/opt/root/lib/std.pcm'.

ROOT installed from the binary distribtution for Ubuntu 22 is broken and can't start, at least for 6.26.08 and 6.26.10 (N.B. this is using WSL2). ### Expected behavior. `root` should start normally. ### To Reproduce. - Install dependencies via `apt`. - N.B. `python` and `python-dev` do not exist on Ubuntu22; use `python3` and `python-is-python3` instead; likewise `libglew1.5-dev` should now be `libglew-dev`. - Download and unpack `root_v6.26.10.Linux-ubuntu22-x86_64-gcc11.3.tar.gz` in `/opt`. - `cd /opt/root; source bin/thisroot.sh`. - Then I get the following:. ```. ➜ which root. /opt/root/bin/root. ➜ root. input_line_1:1:2: fatal error: module file '/home/sftnight/build/ws/BUILDTYPE/Release/LABEL/ROOT-ubuntu2204/V/6-26/build/lib/libc.pcm' not found: module file not found. #include <new>. ^. input_line_1:1:2: note: imported by module 'std' in '/opt/root/lib/std.pcm'.

CMake Error: : System Error: No such file or directory. CMake Error at interpreter/cling/cmake/modules/CMakeLists.txt:22 (configure_file):. configure_file Problem configuring file. ```. Possible source of the issue:. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/cling/cmake/modules/CMakeLists.txt#L4-L5. ### Expected behavior. <!--. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. 1. The configurations works, just as it does on the 6.26 branch. 2. If not feasible, the build error should at least guide the user / package aintainer the configuration option to solve the issue or where to find the solution. ### To Reproduce. 1. Build against the master branch (6.27, 0fafc31efb5a94472af2a6b35ded27796cb141c8) with CMake Flag `-Dbuiltin_llvm=OFF`. (See the external context for steps to reproduce the behavior with the Nix package manager and Nixpkgs.). 2. See error. ### Setup. <!--. 1. ROOT version. 3. Operating system. 4. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself. -->. 1. ROOT version: 6.27.* on the master branch (f9d15227e4c92eac7c6499379912d1ed24d0142b). 2. Operating system: NixOS (Linux), on a x86_64 machine. - system: `""x86_64-linux""`. - host os: `Linux 5.10.156, NixOS, 22.11 (Raccoon), 22.11.20221130.596a8e8`. - multi-user?: `yes`. - sandbox: `yes`. - version: `nix-env (Nix) 2.11.0`. - nixpkgs: `/nix/store/qwgw2b19ga8dr7c6wfpd6p87bdjyrnha-source`. 4. Build with Nix and get dependencies from Nixpkgs. ### Additional context. Here is the build steps to reproduce the issue with Nix. It can be proceed as long as `nix` or `docker` is available.

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->. 1. The configurations works, just as it does on the 6.26 branch. 2. If not feasible, the build error should at least guide the user / package aintainer the configuration option to solve the issue or where to find the solution. ### To Reproduce. 1. Build against the master branch (6.27, 0fafc31efb5a94472af2a6b35ded27796cb141c8) with CMake Flag `-Dbuiltin_llvm=OFF`.

For ROOT 6.27 (LCG dev23 nightly slot) I see a wrong overload resolution for pair of functions that takes argumentof type `double` and `std::complex<double>`.

This in turn makes it hard to test the accuracy of new numerical implementations. In particular, we are trying to fix a bug in `MultiProcess::LikelihoodJob`, which builds on this `KahanSum` fix. This commit adds test cases around the precision limits, making sure that all behavior is now symmetric and internally consistent. To aid in the test cases and also make the `KahanSum` objects more versatile, the commit also adds some extra `-` and `+` operators. Using these, we verify some additional desirable symmetry properties: that x - x = 0, and y + (-x) = y - x.

The improved implementation is based on an algorithm for combining Kahan sums and carry terms used in literature (citation in comments). ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally. - [x] updated the docs (if necessary)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11940

Raw read rules are not (and will likely not be) supported, as they take a `TBuffer &`. ## Changes or fixes:. - Introduce `RFieldBase::AddReadCallbacksFromIORules()`. This function registers a post-read callback for each of the given `ROOT::TSchemaRule`s. - `RFieldBase::ConnectPageSource()`: cache C++ type version as stored in the RNTupleDescriptor. This information can be accessed via `GetOnDiskTypeVersion()`. `RFieldBase::RegisterReadCallbacks()` is called as part of `ConnectPageSource()`. This function can be overridden; in particular, derived classes can make use of the on-disk type version to enable/disable read rules. - RClassField: register a post-read callback for each of the custom I/O rules associated with the target class version. - I/O customization rules referencing non-transient members are ignored for now. Such rules shall trigger a warning, e.g. ```. 210: Warning in <[ROOT.NTuple] Warning /home/jalopezg/CERN/repos/root/tree/ntuple/v7/src/RField.cxx:931 in . ROOT::Experimental::RClassField::RClassField(std::string_view, std::string_view, TClass*)::<lambda(const . ROOT::TSchemaRule*)>>: ignoring I/O customization rule with non-transient member: a. ```. ## Checklist:. - [X] tested changes locally. - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is. -->. When importing data from a TTree, I specify a set of `RooRealVar`s that tell RooFit which branches I want to pull data from. It is my understanding that if a value is less than the bounds of a particular `RooRealVar`, it is excluded. This is not in fact the case. One issue stems from [this method](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/98f6c2f17918a5fcf16f84d6d64a3dd1f11d0fab/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooAbsRealLValue.cxx#L93) or [this line in the code](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/98f6c2f17918a5fcf16f84d6d64a3dd1f11d0fab/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooAbsRealLValue.cxx#L132), where I found that RooFit actually adds `1e-6` to either side of that comparison. I couldn't find this documented anywhere, and I'm not really sure why it's there to begin with, but maybe someone here with more knowledge of the code has a reason for why this is the way it is. This is less of a bug and more a lack of documentation. I would also consider the second implementation of `inRange` [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/98f6c2f17918a5fcf16f84d6d64a3dd1f11d0fab/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooAbsRealLValue.cxx#L493) troubling, as it adds an `epsilon = 1e-8 * fabs(val)` to the comparison (and switches from `<` to `<=`.

One in [span.hxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/foundation/inc/ROOT/span.hxx#L147). ```. namespace std {. inline namespace __ROOT {. template<class T>. class span { ... };. }}. ```. and one provided in a header by g++ or libstdc++. . I feel that unless one is developing a libstdc++, there are few valid cases of declaring stuff in the std namespace. (Exceptions include overloading operators for iostream with custom classes.) The point of having namespaces in the first place is to avoid such collisions! The following actions would resolve my complaint:. * Merging this PR or something similar and replacing std::span with std::__ROOT_NI::span (or perhaps ROOT::span?) . * Removing span.hxx from the API, using it only internally during ROOT compilation. * Requiring C++20 and using the std::span which comes with the users libstdc++. * Shipping your own libstdc++, thus taking responsibility for the whole std namespace. .

But while trying to do that, I noticed that my compiler got confused because it had multiple definitions of ``std::span``:. One in [span.hxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/foundation/inc/ROOT/span.hxx#L147). ```. namespace std {. inline namespace __ROOT {. template<class T>. class span { ... };. }}. ```. and one provided in a header by g++ or libstdc++. . I feel that unless one is developing a libstdc++, there are few valid cases of declaring stuff in the std namespace. (Exceptions include overloading operators for iostream with custom classes.) The point of having namespaces in the first place is to avoid such collisions! The following actions would resolve my complaint:. * Merging this PR or something similar and replacing std::span with std::__ROOT_NI::span (or perhaps ROOT::span?) . * Removing span.hxx from the API, using it only internally during ROOT compilation. * Requiring C++20 and using the std::span which comes with the users libstdc++. * Shipping your own libstdc++, thus taking responsibility for the whole std namespace. .
