This looks like a great tool and I would like to give it a try, but I encountered an issue when attempting to install it. This issue might be due to our old server, which is a CentOS6.9 with gcc 4.8.2. Are there other system parameters you want to know? Installation went fine on my own Ubuntu 17.10.

First, let me just say I have been working with fastp for over a month now and am very pleased with the performance and direction the tool is going. It also appears to be quite accurate and look forward to the forthcoming publication. However, I have noticed that the adapter trimming does not efficiently trim under certain conditions where quality dips but there is still an exact match to the adapters on both read pairs. In this case I've synthetic data that is centered at 35Q and 20Q. . I was going through a tool evaluation comparison using this data and found that fastp excels in most cases with >99% sensitivity trimming and near perfect specificity. However, as the qualities drop near 20Q the sensitivity also drops dramatically. Some tools have no loss of adapter clipping with respect to quality shifting. Note my usage and that I am not doing any quality trimming. . Any ideas on how we can better address the below scenario? Here is one example of where clipping fails, adapter starts at pos 114. You can see that fastp successfully trims in one case but not the other. PS- I have more examples if needed. ```. Adapters:. > TruSeq_Index_Adapter_5p.

However, I have noticed that the adapter trimming does not efficiently trim under certain conditions where quality dips but there is still an exact match to the adapters on both read pairs. In this case I've synthetic data that is centered at 35Q and 20Q. . I was going through a tool evaluation comparison using this data and found that fastp excels in most cases with >99% sensitivity trimming and near perfect specificity. However, as the qualities drop near 20Q the sensitivity also drops dramatically. Some tools have no loss of adapter clipping with respect to quality shifting. Note my usage and that I am not doing any quality trimming. . Any ideas on how we can better address the below scenario? Here is one example of where clipping fails, adapter starts at pos 114.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/33:46,availability,down,downstream,46,"Trimming for polyA/T/C; improved runtimes for downstream alignment and variant calling; Shifu;. Congrats on the paper in bioRxiv and thanks for all the great work on fastp. We've been working on improving the runtimes for somatic variant calling workflows and exploring quality and polyX trimming. We did a test run with fastp and atropos and found that the major improvements in runtime were due to removal of polyX sequences at the 3' ends of reads:. https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio_validations/tree/master/somatic_trim. We'd used the new polyG trimming functionality (thank you), but a crude method of 3' polyA/T/C adapter removal, which appears to be less effective with fastp compared to atropos trimming. When additional polyX stretches get removed we get much better runtimes for alignment and variant calling. I saw general polyX and low complexity trimming are on the roadmap for fastp and would like to express my support for this. We've been making great use of fastp for adapter conversion and would like to offer trimming as part of an effort to speed up alignment and variant calling both on NovaSeqs and more generally. As a secondary help for integration, is streaming trimming a possibility for paired ends?

I am seeing a large portion of NextSeq reads that have the poly-G tail, and have successfully trimmed that off with fastp.

We use fastp before our alignment and further analysis. I recently discovered that there seems to be some randomness in fastp’s output. I tried running fastp several times on the same pair of FASTQs and got the md5 hash of the resulting file each time. These were my results:. ```.

I can’t find any documentation about nondeterminism in fastp, and grepping the code didn’t find any obvious use of randomness. Do you know what could be causing this? Attached is the script I used (as a .txt file because GitHub won't allow .sh files to be attached here) to get the above and the FASTQ pair I ran it on (the FASTQs are tiny in-silico files I was using for software testing).

I recently discovered that there seems to be some randomness in fastp’s output. I tried running fastp several times on the same pair of FASTQs and got the md5 hash of the resulting file each time. These were my results:. ```. R1: a105a5a858e99989b78d0e1c3958296d | R2: 5cb80d0dd6d4b6a68f18ba6dae0c253b . R1: 3d44196675b9e903b9094bc37707c682 | R2: d0dd697eb44f6f00a8ef0e1e1c448d91 .

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/111:199,availability,cluster,clustering,199,"issue when filtering empty reads; Hi, . The most recent batch of RNA-seq data that I've received back has a small number of completely empty reads (which could potentially be the result of some over-clustering since I've never seen them before).

Here's an example with 4 reads:. ```. @NS500422:705:HWFKTBGX5:1:11101:15654:1151 1:N:0:GATCTATC+AGCCTCAT. GGGTTATGTAGGAGTCAAATGAGAGGTCCTTGAAGTCT. +.

My reads are paired-end (one empty read paired to a read with data) and running them in paired-end mode produced the same output as the above example with the single-end data above.

My reads are paired-end (one empty read paired to a read with data) and running them in paired-end mode produced the same output as the above example with the single-end data above. The program removes the empty read and the next two lines (header and sequence data for the read below), then it looks like it counts line 3 and 4 of that read as lines 1 and 2 going forward, so we end up with only the first two lines of the final read in the example (no ""+"" and no quality scores). I'm not sure how common these empty reads are given that this is the first time I've encountered them, but for me, the simplest solution has been to run the following line of code to replace the empty lines with a single N, and then either run your program (which works normally) or go straight to the downstream analysis step. `sed 's/^$/N/' empty_example.fq > empty_example_with_Ns.fq`",MatchSource.ISSUE,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/111

Another problem I am having is that it won't write reports OR files if it cannot find the right folder, but instead of halting/giving an error it just goes on doing everything without writing anything do disk.

Two other issues (#24 and #65) had the same questions we have, and your answers to those were not detailed enough and neither is the description in the documentation. I'll try to spell out my confusion clearly... The --cut_by_quality documentation references Trimmomatic and ""sliding window"" but it does not work the same way Trimmomatic's SLIDINGWINDOW option works, which is where I think a lot of the confusion comes from. Instead, --cut_by_quality works more similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING options, except it uses a minimum window size of 2 instead of single bases like L/T. Both --cut_by_quality and L/T stop when reaching a window or base above the quality threshold. However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer.

However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer. Finally, a further enhancement would be to include an option that does work like SLIDINGWINDOW.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/122:1688,usability,close,close,1688,"--cut_by_quality3/5 description is confusing; We've been investigating how the --cut_by_quality trimming actually works. Two other issues (#24 and #65) had the same questions we have, and your answers to those were not detailed enough and neither is the description in the documentation. I'll try to spell out my confusion clearly... The --cut_by_quality documentation references Trimmomatic and ""sliding window"" but it does not work the same way Trimmomatic's SLIDINGWINDOW option works, which is where I think a lot of the confusion comes from.

I've been using `fastp` successfully without issue for several months now, but suddenly the program will not process/recognize any reads at all. I have attempted this with both gzipped and uncompressed fastq files with the same results. I even tested this on fastq files that were successfully trimmed with fastp several months ago and it fails. .
