https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/122:103,availability,SLI,SLIDINGWINDOW,103,"@jdrnevich Hi Jenny, I add a new method `--cut_by_quality_aggressive`, which is similar as Trimmomatic SLIDINGWINDOW. I also changed the window size limitation to allow 1 as an option. See the updated document:. `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From v0.19.6, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:. * `-5, --cut_by_quality5` move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. * `-3, --cut_by_quality3` move a sliding window from tail (3') to front, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The trailing N bases are also trimmed. * `--cut_by_quality_aggressive` move a sliding window from front to tail, if meet one window with mean quality below cut_mean_quality, drop the bases in this window and the rest, and stop. This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_by_quality5` will also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***. If `--cut_by_quality_aggressive` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_by_quality3`, since the former is more aggressive. If `--cut_by_quality_aggressive` is enabled together with `--cut_by_quality5`, `--cut_by_quality5` will be performed first before `--cut_by_quality_aggressive` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases. The size of sliding window can be specified with `-W, --cut_window_size`, and the mean quality requirement can be specified with `-M, --cut_mean_quality `.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/122

If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive. If `--cut_right` is enabled together with `--cut_front`, `--cut_front` will be performed first before `--cut_right` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases. Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs. If you don't set window size and mean quality threshold for these function respectively, `fastp` will use the values from `-W, --cut_window_size` and `-M, --cut_mean_quality `",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/122

If I got it right, in step 5 R2 reads would have to be reverse complimented before writing them to s.fastq along with residual R1 reads. Unforutnately, I dont have much knowledge about fastp internals, but by this procedure, fastp could provide merged, paired and unpaired reads in a single step.

Fastp knows when it deals with PE data due to the `-i <input-1-file>` / `-I <input-2-file>` parameters. - If the user wants the paired unmerged files, this could simply be implicitly specified by `-o <output-1-file>` / `-O <output-2-file>`. - If merged reads are wanted, this is currently specified by `-m`. All you need to add is a related argument, so it would become `-m <merged-output-file>`. - If residual unpaired and unmerged reads are desired, just go for `-s <residual-output-file>`.

This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***. If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive. If `--cut_right` is enabled together with `--cut_front`, `--cut_front` will be performed first before `--cut_right` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases. Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs. If you don't set window size and mean quality threshold for these function respectively, `fastp` will use the values from `-W, --cut_window_size` and `-M, --cut_mean_quality `",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/154

I would argue that 5' adapter trimming is probably the only feature fastp is missing to make it the ultimate trimming tool. The additional thing here is that the two reads that remain contain a bit of the Illumina adapter at the 3' end, which fastp trims. It appears that fastp considers trimming complete when it finds that one sequence. **Is this the expected behavior?** I think it would make more sense to find the adapter that trims the largest portion of the read, or at least make ""greedy"" adapter trimming an option.

As you can see from the `fastp` commands with the actual files and with `<(cat $fastq)`, fastp claims there are less reads in the second version.

So not only is it eating reads but not even the same number in both R1 and R2 FASTQ file. I think fastp is trying to seek in the input fastq files, and it can't seek back in the files as they are a pipe and correspondingly looses data. @sfchen Can multiple FASTQ files as input for both `-i` and `-I` be added or at least process substitution be supported for the input files. It also looks like `fastp` does not check if the read names for R1 and R2 are matching.

It also looks like `fastp` does not check if the read names for R1 and R2 are matching. The latter would at least have warned me that something weird was going on.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/183

As you can see from the `fastp` commands with the actual files and with `<(cat $fastq)`, fastp claims there are less reads in the second version. As you can see `R1.out.fq` and `R2.out.fq` contain the same read IDs. `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R1.out.fq` are different, but also `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R2.process_substitution.out.fq`. So not only is it eating reads but not even the same number in both R1 and R2 FASTQ file. I think fastp is trying to seek in the input fastq files, and it can't seek back in the files as they are a pipe and correspondingly looses data. @sfchen Can multiple FASTQ files as input for both `-i` and `-I` be added or at least process substitution be supported for the input files. It also looks like `fastp` does not check if the read names for R1 and R2 are matching.

As you can see from the `fastp` commands with the actual files and with `<(cat $fastq)`, fastp claims there are less reads in the second version. As you can see `R1.out.fq` and `R2.out.fq` contain the same read IDs. `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R1.out.fq` are different, but also `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R2.process_substitution.out.fq`. So not only is it eating reads but not even the same number in both R1 and R2 FASTQ file. I think fastp is trying to seek in the input fastq files, and it can't seek back in the files as they are a pipe and correspondingly looses data. @sfchen Can multiple FASTQ files as input for both `-i` and `-I` be added or at least process substitution be supported for the input files. It also looks like `fastp` does not check if the read names for R1 and R2 are matching. The latter would at least have warned me that something weird was going on.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/183

As you can see from the `fastp` commands with the actual files and with `<(cat $fastq)`, fastp claims there are less reads in the second version. As you can see `R1.out.fq` and `R2.out.fq` contain the same read IDs. `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R1.out.fq` are different, but also `R1.process_substitution.out.fq` and `R2.process_substitution.out.fq`. So not only is it eating reads but not even the same number in both R1 and R2 FASTQ file. I think fastp is trying to seek in the input fastq files, and it can't seek back in the files as they are a pipe and correspondingly looses data. @sfchen Can multiple FASTQ files as input for both `-i` and `-I` be added or at least process substitution be supported for the input files. It also looks like `fastp` does not check if the read names for R1 and R2 are matching. The latter would at least have warned me that something weird was going on.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/183

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/295:355,availability,failur,failure,355,"Hi @uros-sipetic . That's probably because those reads being filtered with `failed_too_short` even with filtering options disabled, were actually fully trimmed from the 5' end, due to low base quality at the first four bases. I used to get confused by this, too. However, when I specified the `--failed_out` option and look into the failed reads with the failure reason `failed_too_short`, I noticed that all that kind of reads have very low `base quality` at the first four reads on 5' end, as below:. ```. @SRR10260015.759 D00562:262:C9G0HANXX:4:2213:8841:2053/2 failed_too_short.
