https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/6:175,usability,tool,tool,175,"@sfchen Hi. I installed the new fastp version on my subsamples. The bug is fixed. I will run the alignment tool after and keep you in touch if everything is fine. I love your tool and I have few question:. - when using the -W and -M options, is it possible to disable the -q, -u and -n options? I tried a -W -M -Q line, but all the options were disables, including the -W and -Q... (I want to use per the ""read cutting by quality options"" and disable the ""quality filtering options"" in the same time).

AAAAAAAAGCTACTTGGAGTACCAATAATAAAGTGAGCCCACCTTCCTGGTACCCAGACATTTCAGGAGGTCGGGAAA. +. 6AAAAAEEEEE/E/EA/E/AEA6EE//AEE66/AAE//EEE/E//E/AA/EEE/A/AEE/EEA//EEEEEEEE6EEAA. ```. In this case, index 1 (I7) is `TATAGCCT`, and index 2 (I5) is `GACCCCCA`. By specifying `--umi_loc=index2`, fastp will append index 2 (I5) to the end of the first part of the read header (both R1 and R2), and the read will become:. ```. @NS500713:64:HFKJJBGXY:1:11101:1675:1101:GACCCCCA 1:N:0:TATAGCCT+GACCCCCA. AAAAAAAAGCTACTTGGAGTACCAATAATAAAGTGAGCCCACCTTCCTGGTACCCAGACATTTCAGGAGGTCGGGAAA. +. 6AAAAAEEEEE/E/EA/E/AEA6EE//AEE66/AAE//EEE/E//E/AA/EEE/A/AEE/EEA//EEEEEEEE6EEAA. ```. And `--umi_loc=index1` will do the same thing for index 1 (I7). If my guess was right, you can look into the README (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp#unique-molecular-identifer-umi-processing) for more details. But if my guess was wrong, please kindly let me know.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/23
https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/23:929,interoperability,compatib,compatible,929,"Shifu;. Thanks for this discussion. It would be great if we had a way to export directly into the indexes but am not sure how to do this with bcl2fastq. The setup we have is dual indexes with the UMI in I7 so it looks like `IIIIIIIINNNNNN` where `I` is the index and `N` is the UMI. We want to use the dual index for demultiplexing and then export the UMIs. So assuming 150 bp reads, 8 bp dual indices and single 6bp UMI in the first index, the bcl2fastq looks like `150Y, 8I6Y, 8I, 150Y` where the 150Y, 6Y and 150Y generate the three files: read1, UMI and read2, respectively. The `8I`s generate the two indexes used in demultiplexing. Is there a way to handle both the demultiplexing and export into the header from bcl2fastq? I definitely see how to use fastp for this case if we could export either to an index or one of read1 or read2, but I might easily be ignorant about how best to setup bcl2fastq to generate something compatible. Thanks again for helping with this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/23

You're right, AFAIK, bcl2fastq cannot use a part of index as UMI. . If you use fastp only for processing UMI (without any filtering/adapter/correction), there is a way to do: processing R1+R3 and R2+R3 individually.

You may also specify `-G` to disable polyG end trimming if you're processing data from NextSeq / NovaSeq, but polyG end trimming will not discard reads so it will not break the read consistency. The performance will be mainly unaffected since only R3.fq is loaded twice, which is very small since it's only 6 bp long. And actually you can run these two commands in parallel so that the performance may be even better :).

Although you've closed this issue, I still have an important note about the method I proposed to run R1+R3 and R2+R3 individually. .

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/33:184,safety,detect,detected,184,"Hi Brad and Oliver,. I'd like to ask some questions about polyX trimming:. 1.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/33:304,availability,sli,slippage,304,"Shifu;. Thanks so much for considering this feature. In terms of motivation, I think the polyX trimming is separate from NovaSeq polyG trims. There isn't a NovaSeq mechanism contributing to polyA/T/C since this is also present in non-NovaSeq (HiSeq and friends) reads. Rather this is due to some kind of slippage issue or is sequencing real signal. But either way what happens with this during variant calling is that these reads pile up on A stretches of the genome, creating very deep pileups of noise which take a long time to variant call through especially when identifying low frequency somatic variants. So, I'd suggest having these as separate options. Some users might want only polyG and to keep the other poly stretches. I think having both as optional flags is probably the best option for now until trimming these becomes more standard accepted practice. Regarding streaming for paired end reads, there are a couple of use cases where we could take advantage of this;. - Streaming interleaved reads directly into mappers like bwa and minimap2. So instead of `-o` and `-O`, stream both ends, interleaved, directly to standard out. - Streaming into bgzip preparation of reads, doing something like `-o >(bgzip --threads 8 > out_R1.fq.gz) -O >(bgzip --threads 8 > out_R2.fq.gz)`. This would help us prepare bgzipped outputs which are indexable for looks like grabix (https://github.com/arq5x/grabix) so we could parallelize subsequent alignment over regions of the fastq file.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/33:73,deployability,log,logic,73,"Shifu -- thanks for this. Generally I thought these should fall into the logic of being > poly_x_min_len (which I left at 10) and the logic of 1 allowed mismatch per 8bp with a maximum of 5 mismatches. Are you requiring that the polyX stretch initiate with the 3' most end and implicitly disallowing mismatches there? MSIs should primarily by in more complex di-nucleotide+ repeats (like the first 4 examples in the remaining trim) and I agree the polyX shouldn't touch those to avoid messing with these. Exploring low complexity filters and the impact of this type of detection would be a useful secondary filter but something more long term. We're hoping to isolate the smaller set of trimming changes which help most with runtimes as a first pass, so clearing out the remaining noisy polyT and other reads would be helpful.

What is more, we can archive the multiplexed bam files and delete Illumina run folders. If we expperience a problem with barcodes, it is much easier to rerun demultiplexing on bam files instead of `.tar.gz` BCL files. bam files might take a bit more space but we don't think it is important considering their added benefit. IMHO, you can simply use HTSlib to read bam files and process them just like the reads that you get from fastq files.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/52:592,energy efficiency,reduc,reduce,592,Example trimming:. I want to trim my PE dataset like this:. - trim quality at 3' end. - trim poly G and poly A at 3' end. - finally trim 10 bases from both ends 5' and 3' of read pair. .. order is important. Theoretically I could do this in just one single call of `fastp`. In practice I need to know the order of execution of the individual steps. Alternatively I would need to run trimming in two or more separate processes like this to force a certain order of execution:. `fastp <quality/polyX params> | fastp <cut bases at all ends params>` or something similiar. ut that would probably reduce speed ... . Any thoughts on that? thanks :-),MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/52

Please note that the trimming for `--max_len` limitation will be applied at the last step. Following are fastp's processing steps that may orderly affect the read lengthes:. ```. 1, UMI preprocessing (--umi). 2, global trimming at front (--trim_front). 3, global trimming at tail (--trim_tail). 4, quality pruning at 5' (--cut_by_quality5). 5, quality pruning at 3' (--cut_by_quality3). 6, trim polyG (--trim_poly_g, enabled by default for NovaSeq/NextSeq data). 7, trim polyX (--trim_poly_x). 8, trim adapter by overlap analysis (enabled by default for PE data). 9, trim adapter by adapter sequence (--adapter_sequence, --adapter_sequence_r2. For PE data, this step is skipped if last step succeeded). 10, trim to max length (---max_len). ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/88

In single cell RNA-seq experiments it is very common to have paired-end sequencing. The first read contains **only** barcodes, in the case of 10x Genomics kits (which are very common as well) it 1 barcode for the cell (16 bp) and 1 barcode for each transcript (10 bp), resulting in a total of 26 bp. It would be silly to apply filtering and trimming to this read because these sequences are artificial and always have to be the same length. Instead, the second read comes from the actual transcript, therefore it makes sense to apply filtering and trimming for quality control. At our institute, we use a Illumina NovaSeq sequencer, I would say it's a fairly common machine. I receive two FASTQ files, one containing all read 1, and the other containing all read 2, of course inside the corresponding pairs are in the same order. As described above, if I run fastp on both FASTQ files I run into problems because barcodes are filtered or trimmed. Instead, if I submit only the FASTQ file of the read 2 (from the transcript), the output FASTQ will have fewer reads than read 1 (because it wasn't filtered). This will cause problems later on because the paired FASTQ files are expected to be in sync.

That means, if a read was removed from the R2 FASTQ file, the corresponding read in the R1 FASTQ must be removed as well. Otherwise, you'll end up having different number of reads in the FASTQ files.

After running fastp only on read 2 (in single-end mode), I tried to 'sync' the files manually myself but wasn't able to make it work. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text but I hope this better explains the situations.As I said, I think it shouldn't be too challenging and in my opinion a lot of people could benefit from this (also because single cell RNA-seq experiments are becoming more and more standard and almost always require paired-end sequencing, often having one of the reads containing just barcodes).

That means, if a read was removed from the R2 FASTQ file, the corresponding read in the R1 FASTQ must be removed as well. Otherwise, you'll end up having different number of reads in the FASTQ files. So I was wondering, since your tool is already able to process paired-end FASTQ files and keep them in sync, if it was possible to use both FASTQ files as input for fastp, but then apply the filtering only to the reads of one of the two files (in this case read 2) and just keep the other one in sync. Technically, I assume this shouldn't be a big challenge. I would like to look at this myself but I'm not very familiar with C++ and don't have spare time at the moment. After running fastp only on read 2 (in single-end mode), I tried to 'sync' the files manually myself but wasn't able to make it work. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text but I hope this better explains the situations.As I said, I think it shouldn't be too challenging and in my opinion a lot of people could benefit from this (also because single cell RNA-seq experiments are becoming more and more standard and almost always require paired-end sequencing, often having one of the reads containing just barcodes).

At our institute, we use a Illumina NovaSeq sequencer, I would say it's a fairly common machine. I receive two FASTQ files, one containing all read 1, and the other containing all read 2, of course inside the corresponding pairs are in the same order. As described above, if I run fastp on both FASTQ files I run into problems because barcodes are filtered or trimmed. Instead, if I submit only the FASTQ file of the read 2 (from the transcript), the output FASTQ will have fewer reads than read 1 (because it wasn't filtered). This will cause problems later on because the paired FASTQ files are expected to be in sync. When I say 'in sync', I mean that the read pairs are in the same order in their respective FASTQ file, and that only pairs are present. That means, if a read was removed from the R2 FASTQ file, the corresponding read in the R1 FASTQ must be removed as well. Otherwise, you'll end up having different number of reads in the FASTQ files.
