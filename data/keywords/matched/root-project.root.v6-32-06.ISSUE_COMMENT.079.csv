Not able to recognize SSL version 3.1.0, disable SSL. ```. and `civetweb` is built with `-DNO_SSL` but `libssl.so.3` still gets linked. As I understand, this is because the `libRHTTP.so` is linked to `libNet.so` which links `libssl.so.3`. This is quite misleading as looking at `ldd libRHTTP.so` one can come to conclusion that it has been built with support of openssl even though this is not the case.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12900:251,security,availab,available,251,"> Thanks, I now realize I rendered `m_externalIncrementalExecutor` unused in commit [9b2041e](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/9b2041e3000a1d86bbad0595b2bc8e2deb8e247a)... > . > Instead of our own `DelegateGenerator`, did you try using the available `ReexportsGenerator` with `Jit->getMainJITDylib()`? Yes, indeed my first try at this was. ```c++. return std::make_unique<ReexportsGenerator>(Jit->getMainJITDylib(), JITDylibLookupFlags::MatchAllSymbols);. ```. but it didn't seem to work. I think this might be related to the issue described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74405679/cannot-resolve-symbols-by-reexportsgenerator-in-llvm-orc-jit), and as far as I could see without diving too deep, is that it may have something to do with linker-mangled name vs. IR symbol name. Thus, if `ReexportsGenerator` cannot be used _directly_, I propose this fix instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12900

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12940:63,deployability,build,build,63,"Hi @bendavid, with this PR we are officially not supporting to build ROOT with these minuit omp or mpi build options anymore:. * https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12970. I'll close this issue here, because not it's clear that RooFit can't be used with Minuit2 multithreading. You are right that it's not unreasonable to expect that Minuit2 multithreading can be enabled/disabled at runtime, but this is another issue. Given the limited developer time we have, I think we need a better motivation than ""we realized it would be nice to have"" to implement this.

The other way around is expected, with RooFit you can't read back a RooWorkspace with any ROOT version that is older that the version it was created with. When I run the reproducer in the debugger, I get this stack trace:. ```. Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted. 0x00007ffff4a9f26c in ?? () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6.

To me that looks more like a problem with IO than with HistFactory (the memory layout of the `HistFactory::Measurement` classes hasn't changed from 6.26 to 6.28. Is that something that makes sense to you, @pcanal? What does this `nbig` stand for, and in which circumstances can this be `-1`? Maybe in the best case, the fix would just be adding a simple `if(nbig >= 0)` before the call to `resize()`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967

The other way around is expected, with RooFit you can't read back a RooWorkspace with any ROOT version that is older that the version it was created with.
