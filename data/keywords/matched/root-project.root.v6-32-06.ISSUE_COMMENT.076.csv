Blame of this if statement gets me to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/9237f8c51c53e4805adda9f0a1d0c0242e484fca. But it doesn't really help me here...

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it...

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12496:836,integrability,batch,batch,836,"Hi Oliver, thanks for the follow up! I did a bit more investigation:. Here is even more reduced reproducible code in python3 with ROOT 6.26/10 on Centos7:. ```python. import ROOT. def test_function():. # comment next line and everything works. ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(2). test = ROOT.TCanvas(""test"", ""test"", 800, 800). print(""First canvas has been created""). print(""Next: Create canvas again with the same name and get the warning""). test = ROOT.TCanvas(""test"", ""test2"", 800, 800). print(""Second canvas has been created.""). print(""I should have gotten undefined behaviour at this point. E.g. Seg. fault.""). test_function(). ```. It seems to return undefined behaviour (as sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't) somewhere during the initialisation of the second canvas... Here is the full backtrace, when it returns the seg. fault:. ```batch. First canvas has been created. Next: Create canvas again with the same name and get the warning.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12496:836,performance,batch,batch,836,"Hi Oliver, thanks for the follow up! I did a bit more investigation:. Here is even more reduced reproducible code in python3 with ROOT 6.26/10 on Centos7:. ```python. import ROOT. def test_function():. # comment next line and everything works. ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(2). test = ROOT.TCanvas(""test"", ""test"", 800, 800). print(""First canvas has been created""). print(""Next: Create canvas again with the same name and get the warning""). test = ROOT.TCanvas(""test"", ""test2"", 800, 800). print(""Second canvas has been created.""). print(""I should have gotten undefined behaviour at this point. E.g. Seg. fault.""). test_function(). ```. It seems to return undefined behaviour (as sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't) somewhere during the initialisation of the second canvas... Here is the full backtrace, when it returns the seg. fault:. ```batch. First canvas has been created. Next: Create canvas again with the same name and get the warning. Warning in <TCanvas::Constructor>: Deleting canvas with same name: test. *** Break *** segmentation violation. ===========================================================. There was a crash.

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it... Blame of this if statement gets me to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/9237f8c51c53e4805adda9f0a1d0c0242e484fca. But it doesn't really help me here...

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it...

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it...

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it... Blame of this if statement gets me to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/9237f8c51c53e4805adda9f0a1d0c0242e484fca. But it doesn't really help me here...

As I understand, something goes wrong during the `TUnixSystem::DispatchOneEvent()`, which causes the crash.. E.g. it tries to access already deleted canvas? As you say this doesn't happen in Mac, I have checked and `TMacOSXSystem::DispatchOneEvent()` has slightly different implementation:. **Relevant part in Unix**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx#L1049-L1057. **Relevant part in Mac**. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/79a67bf050101a9a7aad9089b6e79200b7ab9ce3/core/macosx/src/TMacOSXSystem.mm#L362-L374. Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it... Blame of this if statement gets me to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/9237f8c51c53e4805adda9f0a1d0c0242e484fca. But it doesn't really help me here...

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12497:254,integrability,Version,Version,254,"Hi @dpiparo. Everything seems to be working fine in the new web-based `TBrowser`. However, the issue still exists in the old `TBrowser` if you run my attached reproducible above as:. `root --web=off test.cpp`. I have just tested it on Centos7 with. ROOT Version: 6.31/01. Built for linuxx8664gcc on Feb 05 2024, 00:01:55. From heads/master@v6-31-01-912-gfda4630. It is still an issue, as I cannot run the web-based `Tbrowser` on my working group server, in the ssh session, where I don't have admin rights for everything.
