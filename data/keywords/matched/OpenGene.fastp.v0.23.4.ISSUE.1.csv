https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/195:321,deployability,Depend,Depending,321,"feature request: trim_tail only when adapter is detected; Thanks for this wonderful tool. I really like the before/after comparisons. I would like to replace cutdapt with fastp in my workflows. I sometimes use kits that has a 10-bp connector in addition to the Illumina adapter and the sequence of this connector varies. Depending on the fragment size and read length, this connector may or may not be sequenced. I know I have the option of trimming 10bp at 3' of all reads, but that seems like a waste of data if the connector is not even in the read. I would hope for a feature that would allow trimming 10bp at the 3' only when the Illumina adatper is detected. cutadpt deals with this by allowing Ns in the adapter sequences (-a N{10}AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA). fastp currently does not allow Ns in the adapter sequence.

I really like the before/after comparisons. I would like to replace cutdapt with fastp in my workflows. I sometimes use kits that has a 10-bp connector in addition to the Illumina adapter and the sequence of this connector varies. Depending on the fragment size and read length, this connector may or may not be sequenced. I know I have the option of trimming 10bp at 3' of all reads, but that seems like a waste of data if the connector is not even in the read. I would hope for a feature that would allow trimming 10bp at the 3' only when the Illumina adatper is detected. cutadpt deals with this by allowing Ns in the adapter sequences (-a N{10}AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA). fastp currently does not allow Ns in the adapter sequence.

As a sequencing service provider running devices from MiSeq to NovaSeq we deal with quite a lot of fastq files. . Just two tiny suggestions concerning some plots:. - the `quality` plots should scale on y-axis from 0 to 40 for phred33 (at least optionally) as this way it is by far easier to visually detect relevant differences in a set of files. The scaled (y-zoomed) view makes some plots look more dramatical than they are. - the same is valid for `base content` plot: scaling from 0 to 100% (you are using % in the legend so why not using it on the axis as well?) would make plots - put side by side for some samples - better comparable. And it would also be easier to spot issues in a set of files. - maybe an idea: you could create a plot with fractions of trimmed data (polyA,adapter,quality,whatever can be trimmed from 3' end) over the position (cycle number). The different fractions in different colors. In untrimmed data this would be a line slowly raising towards the end of a read where e.g. low quality increases and where adapters are likely to begin. This is a good tool to see how trimming has worked (or not). Especially when we have the ""before/after"" plots side-by-side in the report.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/232:785,usability,input,input,785,"adapter trimming by overlap analysis; I have just used fastp (thank you) and I have one comment and one question. comment 1:. I saw that a paired-end read attached below were trimmed,. where I used the following parameter:. --adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT -l 50 -y -p. The overlapped sequence is similar but the trimmed sequence is not similar to the input adapter sequence. When I rerun fastp further with --overlap_diff_limit 3 --overlap_diff_percent_limit 10. So I know that I can avoid overtrimming but I think that it seems good that when pairs of reads are overlapped and adapter sequences are specified, the overhanged sequences are not trimmed if they are unsimilar to the input adapter sequences. --input--. @ID1 1:N:0:CTACGACA+GAGTCCAA.

I have used it for roughly a year and am very happy with it. However, there is one thing that bugs me. When fastp is called to merge paired-end files, it also changes the descriptor on the id-line. I couldn't find an option to turn off this behaviour. When I tried using cutadapt after merging it wouldn't let me, because the description is not the same as the ID line. To be honest, I think cutadapt should print a warning and be done with it. They are kind of right though, as according to most sources, + should either be followed by the id or just with a \n.
