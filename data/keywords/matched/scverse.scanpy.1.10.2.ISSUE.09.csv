https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/903:310,modifiability,Extens,Extensive,310,Adding the Self-Assembling Manifold algorithm to scanpy; This is a pull request to integrate the Self-Assembling Manifold (SAM) algorithm into scanpy. A brief summary of the method:. SAM iteratively rescales the expressions of genes based on their spatial variability along the intrinsic manifold of the data. Extensive benchmarking has shown this approach to improve dimensionality reduction and feature selection for both 'easy' and 'challenging' datasets. SAM is especially powerful when analyzing datasets with only subtle differences in gene expression between cell types. More information can be found in the eLife publication: https://elifesciences.org/articles/48994. I still need to write the test script as well as ensure that the added code follows the BLACK coding style.

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/915:498,availability,avail,available,498,"`sc.metrics` module (add confusion matrix & Geary's C methods); This PR adds a module `sc.metrics` for functions which wouldn't modify an anndata object, but are useful calculations. I'm basing this on `sklearn.metrics`, namely, how `sklearn` has separated transformers (`sc.tl`) from measurements. I've started it with two functions, `confusion_matrix` and `gearys_c` but think there are more use cases (e.g. `modularity`). I'm open to this not being a module, but I think these methods should be available and I'm not sure where they'd fit within the current api. My vision for this module is to make it easier to calculate values based on values you'd get using the scanpy ecosystem.

I can read fine an h5ad file and run various steps with scanpy and I can then save the object as an h5ad file and read it back without a problem. However, if I run the rank_genes_groups function, even though I can perfectly fine save my object as an h5ad file I get an error when I am attempting to read it back.

Hi,. not really a bug, more of a documentation issue: . `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups` seems to expect log-transformed data (be it in `.X` or `.raw.X`). To my knowledge this is **not mentioned in the docs**. I just ran into trouble and then found out via #671 and #517 . . It's not a problem for the p-values (if the data is not log-transformed it just does the t-test etc on the counts), but the resulting fold-changes are wrong (it essentially tries to undo the expected log-transform):. ```python. foldchanges = (np.expm1(mean_group) + 1e-9) / (np.expm1(mean_rest) + 1e-9). ```. I was totally unaware of this (been using scanpy for quite a while), especially since I usually store the plain raw counts in the `adata.raw` field, which is used *by default* in `rank_genes_groups`. We should at least mention it in the docstring, but these things are easy to overlook too... Is there any way that scanpy records the transformations you've done to the data (and if the log is missing, just spits out an error in rank_genes_groups)? Also, is there a ""best-practice"" guide of what data to store in which parts of the AnnData objects? `.raw` and the `.layer` dont have a lot of documentation. #### Versions:. <!-- Output of scanpy.logging.print_versions() -->. > scanpy==1.4.4.post1 anndata==0.6.22.post1 umap==0.3.10 numpy==1.17.3 scipy==1.3.1 pandas==0.25.2 scikit-learn==0.21.3 statsmodels==0.10.1 python-igraph==0.7.1 louvain==0.6.1.",MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/967
