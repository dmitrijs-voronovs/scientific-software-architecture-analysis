https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/394:282,usability,document,documentation,282,"Entity Linker - documentation issues and questions; Hello,. I am experimenting with the entity linkers and I have a couple of questions/comments. If you prefer I can make separate issues for each of them but I think it's clearer to have a single issue. First small question: Is the documentation for the linkers and candidate generators outdated? The docstring for CandidateGenerator says. > A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available:. > - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). > - Medical Subject Headings (MESH). But the readme lists a few other ontologies as well (and they do seem to be handled in the code). Second higher level question: I'm interested in your reasons for using specifically 3-gram tf-idf vectorization for ANN for candidate generation? Did you publish a paper or something I could read? I would like to experiment with using pre-trained word embeddings instead, but it seems like a rather obvious idea, so I'm curious if there are reasons you didn't do that in the first place? Related to that, if I wanted to generate an index based on word embeddings - how expensive is the generation of the ANN index? I only have limited computing capabilities available, and the default value for the number of threads in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/3d153ddad1f11f000f961f7a92c0d862b93c0973/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L396. > num_threads = 60 # set based on the machine.

This was the dominant focus of our coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neurology departmental meeting at the start of the epidemic weeks ago, where a neurologist in his late 50s assured us we were at minimal danger from coronavirus, and our efforts should focus on protecting our high-risk patients. But do we know exactly who these 'high-risk' people are? Although there was limited data to guide them, our hospital, the CDC, 1 and various medical associations repeated the intuitive refrain that 'high risk' patients are the 'immunocompromised and elderly.'A hospital-wide high-risk patient working group was established early on, consisting of neuroimmunologists and other physicians across disciplines that care for immunocompromised individuals. Specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding COVID-19 was pushed out quickly. Appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible, before appointments for other patients.The inclusion of immunocompromised patients in the 'high-risk population' for COVID-19 is intuitive-immunosuppression should make a person more likely to contract an infection and may prolong the disease course. However, the data thus far has not borne this out. Early analyses of large Chinese cohorts have identified risk factors such as older age, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, but not immunosuppression, as risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19. 2 In addition, data on prior related coronavirus outbreaks in MERS 3 and SARS 4 did not show any evidence of increased risk of infection or morbidity in ",MatchSource.ISSUE,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/404

A pediatric liver transplant center in Italy reported no significant pulmonary disease from COVID-19 amongst their patients with autoimmune liver disease, on chemotherapy, or those who were post-transplant. 7 An analysis from China did note increased rates of infection and morbidity in cancer patients, 8 however, it did not adjust for age, included patients many years out from their cancer treatments, and has been the subject of several responses that contest the conclusion of increased risk to cancer patients. 9,10 Indeed, one response raised the point that decreased access to quality medical care, rather than the virus itself, is the primary danger facing cancer patients in the current pandemic. 10 No data exists regarding other transplant, rheumatologic or neuroimmunological conditions, which itself prompts the question of whether these patients are indeed at higher risk than the general population.Not only ha",MatchSource.ISSUE,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/404

A hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome, driving severe and deadly cases of COVID-19. 11 Clinical investigations into the utility of various immunosuppressive agents in COVID-19, including tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), Janus kinus (JAK) inhibitors, and others are ongoing. 12 Instead of focusing on immunosuppression, we need to re-consider who qualifies as an 'elderly' person in regards to COVID-19 risk. Advanced older age as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and death has been well substantiated. Over 1 out of 5 patients in Italy over the age of 80 succumbed to the disease, 13 and according to the CDC, 31-70% of confirmed COVID-19 patients over the age of 85 in the United States require hospitalization. 1 Lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as 'our grandparents,' 'nursing home residents,' or 'retirees.' And yet, while the very elderly in their 80s are most severely affected by the disease, the median age of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in a large retrospective study in China was only 52 years. 14 The case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3.5% in Italy and 3.6% in China, and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common. 13 Morbidity may peak in society's oldest members, but anyone older than 50 is far from safe, and many in this group represent our health care workers, grocery store employees, government leaders, caregivers, and other members of society serving essential functions in the midst of this crisis.

A hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome, driving severe and deadly cases of COVID-19. 11 Clinical investigations into the utility of various immunosuppressive agents in COVID-19, including tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), Janus kinus (JAK) inhibitors, and others are ongoing. 12 Instead of focusing on immunosuppression, we need to re-consider who qualifies as an 'elderly' person in regards to COVID-19 risk. Advanced older age as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and death has been well substantiated. Over 1 out of 5 patients in Italy over the age of 80 succumbed to the disease, 13 and according to the CDC, 31-70% of confirmed COVID-19 patients over the age of 85 in the United States require hospitalization. 1 Lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as 'our grandparents,' 'nursing home residents,' or 'retirees.' And yet, while the very elderly in their 80s are most severely affected by the disease, the median age of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in a large retrospective study in China was only 52 years. 14 The case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3.5% in Italy and 3.6% in China, and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common. 13 Morbidity may peak in society's oldest members, but anyone older than 50 is far from safe, and many in this group represent our health care workers, grocery store employees, government leaders, caregivers, and other members of society serving essential functions in the midst of this crisis.

First of all, thankyou very much for all the hard work you've put in to make SciSpacy for us. I need some help with NEL; it's my first time using scispacy. I'm quite new to this, but what I know from my research is that the MeSH system doesn't have genetic diseases. That’s why any “complete” disease ontology that uses MeSH will also use OMIM. My question is: Is there any way to do this with scispacy? Like any way to use both systems for a piece of text so that what MeSH misses OMIM covers.
