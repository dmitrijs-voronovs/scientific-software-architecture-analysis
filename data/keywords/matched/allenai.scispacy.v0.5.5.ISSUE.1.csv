This counterintuitive fi nding can be explained by taking into account the fact that audiences do not watch informative content merely to inform themselves; they have other motivations that might override credibility concerns. For example, they might follow media primarily for entertainment purposes and consequently put less emphasis on the quality of the received information.As <|CITE|> have claimed, audiences tend to approach and process information differently depending on the channel; they approach television primarily for entertainment and newspapers primarily for information. This has implications for trust as well since audiences in an entertainment processing mode will be less attentive to credibility cues, such as news errors, than those in an information processing mode (Ibid.). <|CITE|> research confi rms this claim -he found that audiences tend to approach newspaper reading more actively than television viewing and that credibility assessments differ regarding whether audience members approach news actively or passively. These fi ndings can help explain why we found a weak positive correlation between television news exposure and trust in journalism. It could be that audiences turn to television not because they expect the best quality information but rather the opposite -namely, that they approach television news less critically, focus less attention on credibility concerns and, therefore, develop a higher degree of trust in journalism.

So instead of pickling the span, pickle the Doc it belongs to or use Span.as_doc to convert the span to a standalone Doc object. ```.

In recent years the field of evolutionary computation has developed a rigorous analytical theory to analyse their runtime on many illustrative problems.

https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/233:743,testability,review,reviewed,743,"Linking refactor; This is an attempt to make it easier to load other KBs trained via the same mechanism as a pipeline. . Changes:. - `UmlsEntity` -> `Entity`. - `types` argument to `UmlsEntity` is now optional, as not every KB will have types. - Abstract `UmlsKnowledgeBase` into `KnowledgeBase`, which doesn't hold the semantic type tree of UMLS. - Wrap up all the linker paths into a `LinkerPaths` namedtuple, so we can reference groups of them by name. - Pass a `name` arg to the linker and candidate generator, which is enough to construct the various pre-defined linkers we have. ~~I'll actually add the MESH linker in a different PR to keep this one manageable.~~. edit: Yolo it's not much extra code, i'll just add it here.

I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from ""sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to #234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)?

Abstract 1: ""Background: Pazopanib is approved for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The present study was a retrospective registry-based analysis of 426 patients with mRCC treated with pazopanib as first-line targeted therapy. Patients and Methods: The data were obtained from the Renal Cell Carcinoma Information system registry. Patient baseline parameters, treatment course and outcomes, and toxicity were analysed. Results: Median progression-free and overall survival were 12.9 (95% confidence interval(CI)=11.0-14.8) months and 33.2 (95% CI=29.9-36.4) months, respectively. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 25.1% and 57.4%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 37 (12.1%) patients. Conclusion: The results confirm that pazopanib is an effective and safe first-line targeted treatment in patients with mRCC.
