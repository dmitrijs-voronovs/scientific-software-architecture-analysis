ATLAS analysis releases using ROOT 6.18/04 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) use XRootD 4.10.0 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). While releases using ROOT 6.16/00 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) used XRootD 4.8.4 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). My educated guess is that the XRootD version force fed into your jobs @rdschaffer is binary compatible with XRootD 4.8.4, but not with 4.10.0 (or newer).

I cannot reproduce it interactively, and at some grid sites there is. no segfault. What we need is a stack trace to give some clue as to where. the problem is. I understood valgrind would give that, but apparently. nothing useful. The whole thing is running under python, using exec, so maybe this throws. valgrind. For example, there are multiple 'Command' where I expected just 1. for the RD binary, e.g. ==2554== Command: /usr/bin/awk. The grid site could have user/FS/network peculiarities, but it runs in an. identical container everywhere, so there should be no differences in lib. versions. Cheers,. Rod.

The main difference of our current 'minitree production' jobs this round is that we included a build of the MCFM physics generator with the build of our analysis code and we use it while running to calculate physics matrix elements for each event. . So to test this, I rebuilt our analysis code without building MCFM, and of course no longer calculate the matrix elements. I submitted this to the BNL site, and we read the files fine:.

Now there is no matrix element calculated before we start reading the events. So it must be that somehow linking in the MCFM libraries causes problems for calling the gethostname. I must admit that I have no idea how/why this would 'interfere', since MCFM is not run at all before the TFile::Open. . So I think that we can let this bug report rest for now. If anyone might have ideas on how to check or fix the MCFM problem, suggestions are welcome. But I no longer think that xrootd has a problem.
