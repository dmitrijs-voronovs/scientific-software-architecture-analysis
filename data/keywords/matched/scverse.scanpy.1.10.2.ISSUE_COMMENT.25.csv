The build process applies a few patches viewable [here](https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/python-scanpy/-/tree/master/debian/patches). One is a small change to some R code, and the other is I marked several more tests as needs internet because the Debian builds in an environment without network access and those ultimately tried to download something. (And it's really unclear if we can legally redistributed the 10x pbmc3k dataset.). The Debian build file is (here)[https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/python-scanpy/-/blob/master/debian/rules] though mostly it lets you see what tests I was skipping because of missing dependencies. Also if I set a color like in_tissue, or array_row the data shows up. I can paste the full build log if you'd like but this is the dependencies installed and the environment variables. . ```.

The build process applies a few patches viewable [here](https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/python-scanpy/-/tree/master/debian/patches).

https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2048:89,security,patch,patches,89,"I downloaded the github source archive at the 1.8.2 tag. The build process applies a few patches viewable [here](https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/python-scanpy/-/tree/master/debian/patches). One is a small change to some R code, and the other is I marked several more tests as needs internet because the Debian builds in an environment without network access and those ultimately tried to download something. (And it's really unclear if we can legally redistributed the 10x pbmc3k dataset.). The Debian build file is (here)[https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/python-scanpy/-/blob/master/debian/rules] though mostly it lets you see what tests I was skipping because of missing dependencies. Also if I set a color like in_tissue, or array_row the data shows up. I can paste the full build log if you'd like but this is the dependencies installed and the environment variables. . ```.

For some reason if you clone the repository then compile it works in python 3.9+. I cannot explain why the release tarball has issues. As per some other documentation, it is because [tp_print has been removed from type objects for python 3.9+.](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html) See below.

I cannot explain why the release tarball has issues. As per some other documentation, it is because [tp_print has been removed from type objects for python 3.9+.](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html) See below. So, if you clone the repository using git and then install it works! (I am sure there is an explanation). ```. test@mac ~/PythonPackages/forceatlas2$ git pull.
