If I understand correctly, your .sif file was previously built from our Docker version? I'm going to walk through what I've tested so far. Maybe you can check which step is different from your experience. ---. Just to make sure I try it myself, here is what I did:. Get a GPU machine to test with:. ```bash. gcloud compute instances create ""${USER}-gpu"" \. --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \. --maintenance-policy ""TERMINATE"" \. --accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-p100,count=1 \. --image-family ""ubuntu-2004-lts"" \. --image-project ""ubuntu-os-cloud"" \. --machine-type ""n1-standard-16"" \. --boot-disk-size ""300"" \. --zone ""us-west1-b"" \. --min-cpu-platform ""Intel Skylake"". ```. I ssh to the machine `gcloud compute ssh pichuan-gpu --zone us-west1-b`. Because my machine doesn't have Nvidia driver installed, I used:. ```bash. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.6/scripts/install_nvidia_docker.sh. sudo bash -x install_nvidia_docker.sh . ```. (the docker part is probably not necessary. I just need the driver). And then because I want to test Singularity, I install that with:. ```bash. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.6/scripts/install_singularity.sh. sudo bash -x install_singularity.sh . ```. Now, my machine has Singularity. I'll start following https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/deeptrio-quick-start.md#notes-on-singularity. I ran:. ```bash. BIN_VERSION=1.6.0. singularity pull docker://google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}-gpu"". ```. This created the file `deepvariant_deeptrio-1.6.0-gpu.sif` on my machine.

To make sure you can restart from each of the steps, you're on the right track : using `--dry_run=true` to find out what to run is useful. The other part that's missing is: when you want to rerun the next steps (say `call_variants`, after `make_examples` are done), you'll want to be able to access the outputs of the previous step. If you're using the one step `run_deepvariant` or `run_deeptrio` wrapper, the way you can do it is to make sure you specify `--intermediate_results_dir` and point it to your own output directory that you can access later. (The default is temp directory in /tmp, which would be inside Docker and might not be accessible if the run dies). And actually, if you use `--dry_run=true` just for the sake of finding out the commands, and then run each of the steps manually (still through docker), that actually gives you the best control, because you can see where all the intermediate files go. As your point about using a sentinel file after each of the steps finishing - I totally understand the point, and agree that such solution can make resuming the run easier. I can file an internal issue to track this suggestion. However, the feature for resuming runs might not be able to prioritized soon based on our workload. And overall, if you're putting things in a production pipeline, it might be better for you to have more control (by running the steps separately and have full control). I understand this is not ideal. But this is currently a trade-off for my team. If you would be interested in helping us improving run_deepvariant.py and run_deeptrio.py, I'm also open to reviewing pull requests! Thank you for reporting.

To make sure you can restart from each of the steps, you're on the right track : using `--dry_run=true` to find out what to run is useful. The other part that's missing is: when you want to rerun the next steps (say `call_variants`, after `make_examples` are done), you'll want to be able to access the outputs of the previous step. If you're using the one step `run_deepvariant` or `run_deeptrio` wrapper, the way you can do it is to make sure you specify `--intermediate_results_dir` and point it to your own output directory that you can access later. (The default is temp directory in /tmp, which would be inside Docker and might not be accessible if the run dies). And actually, if you use `--dry_run=true` just for the sake of finding out the commands, and then run each of the steps manually (still through docker), that actually gives you the best control, because you can see where all the intermediate files go. As your point about using a sentinel file after each of the steps finishing - I totally understand the point, and agree that such solution can make resuming the run easier. I can file an internal issue to track this suggestion. However, the feature for resuming runs might not be able to prioritized soon based on our workload. And overall, if you're putting things in a production pipeline, it might be better for you to have more control (by running the steps separately and have full control). I understand this is not ideal. But this is currently a trade-off for my team. If you would be interested in helping us improving run_deepvariant.py and run_deeptrio.py, I'm also open to reviewing pull requests! Thank you for reporting.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/750:448,deployability,observ,observe,448,"Hi @gushenweiz . Just to add a bit to Kishwar's answer. Refcall here means that the neural network evaluated the most probable genotype of this position to be homozygous reference. It's not always possible to infer the predictive reason for a specific call being made. . The GenotypeQuality here is 12, which means that DeepVariant's confidence in the call is something like 94%. . Generally, when there is a RefCall with high coverage, we tend to observe that DeepVariant seems to suspect that there is a lot of mismapped reads from some other part of the genome. If you have WGS and are using the WGS model, this makes a lot of sense as that's a very high coverage for standard sequencing.

For long reads, I do not believe that would be the case as most of the reads would span your INDELs accurately, so `--normalize_reads` for PacBio should not be required. In this, we are assuming you are using minimap2 as the mapper. On the other hand, if you are trying to normalize the VCF then you can do it post variant calling.

As @akolesnikov mentions, the reason that the reads are re-aligned in this way has to do with some fundamental aspects of how alignment penalties work. The alignment method, Smith Waterman, has alignment score penalties for gap open and gap extend. These penalties make the alignments you see as scoring higher than ones that open and extend a gap early in the repeat. Those alignment penalties are determined from looking at mismatch, insertion, and deletion rates across large amounts of homologous sequences. They work very well for high sequence complexity regions which have standard types of DNA replication error. In this highly repetitive context, the ways that sequence (specifically repeats) can be extended or deleted is a bit different. It might, in theory, be possible to derive better gap extend scores for regions like this, but this is both very hard and a more fundamental problem.

As @akolesnikov mentions, the reason that the reads are re-aligned in this way has to do with some fundamental aspects of how alignment penalties work. The alignment method, Smith Waterman, has alignment score penalties for gap open and gap extend.

Those alignment penalties are determined from looking at mismatch, insertion, and deletion rates across large amounts of homologous sequences. They work very well for high sequence complexity regions which have standard types of DNA replication error.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/770:137,deployability,observ,observe,137,"Hi @Luosanmu,. For your filtering question. We don't directly calculate many of the statistics in the INFO field for variant calling. We observe that the most effective way to adjust filters is to use the Genotype Quality (GQ) property or the Phred Likelihood (PL) fields (GQ is mathematically derived from PL). Do you want to increase sensitivity? The best way is likely to post-process the VCF to extract the low-confidence REF calls using this field. For the question - why does DeepVariant make a call that differs from GATK. For any single call, it's difficult to say the exact reasons. Sometimes, looking at the reads and the reference in the region can give clues about why a call would be made. If you have an IGV screenshot showing the region it might be informative. DeepVariant does seem very confident that there isn't a variant here. . It would also be helpful to know something about the sequencing and prep. Is this Illumina data? PacBio data? Is this a PCR-free prep, or does it include PCR? things like that. Thank you,. Andrew.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/770
