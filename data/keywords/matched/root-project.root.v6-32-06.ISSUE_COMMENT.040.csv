The problem is that the main type of feynman Diagram, is one where you have the fermions at the left and right side, and a boson + virtual particles (in pairs) in the middle. If this were the only type of feynman diagram, I could do this easily, however sometimes there are other ""irregular"" diagrams, which would be harder to implement.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7828:1220,availability,down,down,1220,"I think it's the right way to go, maybe the ttree datasource could be further specialized to distinguish between TTree and TChain. But, a more notable absence in this logic is horizontal extensions to the dataset, e.g. friends in the case of TTree. So if we imagine this function to be just ""giving an hint about the type of container for the dataset of this RDataFrame"", then it's already good as it is imho. If we want something more detailed, like ""this dataframe will run its computations on a dataset named XXX, stored in a container of type YYY placed at ZZZ"", then we're looking for more. For a ttree without friends, this would translate to. * XXX = name of the tree. * YYY = ROOT file / TFile. * ZZZ = path to the ROOT file. And for a csv table it would be. * XXX = None. * YYY = CSV file. * ZZZ = path to the csv file. If the dataset is horizontally extended through e.g. friends, then the information above is not sufficient to identify the full dataset RDataFrame will run its computations on. For a ttree, we would also need to print out XXX,YYY,ZZZ for any friend of the tree.

For some reason, homebrew (or some of the flags from the cmake configuration above) decides to add: `-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include` which makes the command fail.
