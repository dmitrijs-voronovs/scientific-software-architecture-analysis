https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13287:218,deployability,updat,updated,218,"Hi @kratsg, thanks a lot for the detailed issue report! I see the problem, but I don't understand exactly from your post and the linked pyhf discussion what the expected behavior is. Do you expect the XML schema to be updated to allow for this initial `ShapeFactor` nuisance parameter values, or do you want to prohibit that such a `Measurement` object can even be instantiated? Both solutions have problems in my opinion. Restricting the measurement class would break usecases, and expanding the XML schema is promoting the use of a software component (HistFactory XML) that we consider as legacy. Both changes affect code used in production and are not bugfixes (but extending the HistFactory schema), so they can't be done for ROOT patch releases. So if I fix this one way or the other, the patch would only reach users by ROOT 6.30 which is who knows how many months away. We are currently working on a new IO format to replace the HistFactory XML, which is based on JSON (in the context of the HEP statistics serialization standard), and we plan for it to be ready for general use in ROOT 6.30 too. In that case, we can make sure that the models of the user in the pyhf issue thread are supported, such that he can share his model with his ROOT-using colleague via JSON. Therefore, what I suggest is to not start working on this issue now, and *only* if it turns out late in the 6.30 development cycle that we probably will not support this usecase in the HS3 JSON for some unforeseen reason, we can extend the XML schema. This way, we're sure that this problem is solved in ROOT 6.30. Does this sound okay to you, or do you have other suggestions?

Letting each thread create its own library via `CompileMacro` highlights other types of data races, that I think might be better treated in a separate PR. Just to give an example, these are 2 thread stacktraces in a modified test (see at the bottom). ```. (gdb) t 3.
