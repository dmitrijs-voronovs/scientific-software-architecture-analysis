For now, I simply hope this didn't break anything in your https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/pull/199. For future work on the plotting part of Scanpy: I need to think about adding tests for this... In case that you have an idea for doing this in the best way, I'm happy to ready about it... As a simple solution, if you don't mind, I'd add the calls from your [gist](https://gist.github.com/fidelram/2289b7a8d6da055fb058ac9a79ed485c) to the introductory clustering notebook, so that I make sure that I don't break anything.

Those functions are wrappers around `scanpy.api.pl.heatmap`, `scanpy.api.pl.stacked_violin`, `scanpy.api.pl.dotplot` and `scanpy.api.pl.matrixplot`. `heatmap` and `dotplot` were modified to allow the 'brackets' on top of the images. This functionality can be used directly from those plots. E.g.:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43771788-83bbb604-9a40-11e8-90d6-51f084343a98.png). The `pl.stacked_violin` plot was before part of `pl.violin` but I thought that the code is cleaner by separating the two plots. Also, this PR adds the new plot `scanpy.api.pl.matrixplot` that plots the average gene expression per category.

When I plot the same data using rank_genes_groups_dotplot, this error doesn't happen and 'Tnf' is correctly plotted twice. I know this is a small bug that most people will probably not run across, but just in case you're comparing expression across similar groups this might be a useful fix.
