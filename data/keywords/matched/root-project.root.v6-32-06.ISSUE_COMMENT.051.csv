You _can_ reduce the memory required by reducing the number of bins or the number of threads (e.g. with `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(4)`, but there seems to be something else going on: each thread gets a local copy of the histogram, so for their bins the amount of memory required is `8*1000*20000*16` bytes, i.e. 2.4GB. So just the number of histograms and bins does not explain what you see. #6676 is about calling `Histo1D` without specifying a binning, which does not seem to be your case. With a build of ROOT that contains debug symbols (they are available e.g. on LXPLUS), `valgrind --tool=massif` should be able to point precisely to the source of the allocations.

In any case I'm not convinced that bare class name is very useful, I feel I would be more interested in the fully qualified name... and actually in all places you use `name` is for a class in the global namespace, and the only time you have to deal with a class in a namespace (`std::string`) you have to use `klass.__cpp_name__`, so if you change `name` to be the fully qualified version you can *fix* the only exception. Also, I'm not too much in favor of suggesting people to use *private* data members of a Python class, even if we know that it's always there (for the moment).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9128

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9184:1207,availability,error,error,1207,"HI Rahul, thanks for the PR! Here is what I would do to get started with the missing bullet points:. 1. added tutorials. A tutorial that showcases the Taylor expansion feature is definitely welcome! I would show the 1D case, where you Taylor expand let's say a 4th degree polynomial at different orders and plot the Taylor expansions together with the original Polynomial. At 4th order, the Taylor expansion should match with the original. 2. added unit test. For sure we need a unit test for these new features.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9225:936,usability,user,users,936,"@eguiraud Thank you for your detailed response! I currently create some TDirectories representing different stages of seloctions, and write histograms into it. For some reason, I would like to have TTree output also in some of the stages, and for that I need to use the `Snapshot` method. The way I had thought of (haven't tested yet, sorry) would be creating all the directories first and close the file, snapshotting to that file (not sure if the sub-directory could be, specified), and then open it for histogram writing.

A warning about Redefine: there is one annoyance with `Redefine` that I still have to fix: when you redefine e.g. `TestVar1`, that changes the value that `""TestVar1""` points to, but it does not redefine sub-columns such as `""TestVar1.fBits`. As in general the Redefine'd column could have a different type that does not have the same data members, in the near future redefining a column with sub-columns will disable the sub-columns (i.e. they won't be available as column names after the redefine, but rather you'll have to access the main object and then its data members).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9240

During the development of POSIX.1-2017, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to size_t, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 mo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9253
