ROOT::Internal::RIoUring::RIoUring(size_t) [/home/max/projects/rootdev/root/io/io/inc/ROOT/RIoUring.hxx:31]. ```. I ran into a weird error when I was messing around making the `io_uring_queue_init` fail with crazy ring sizes like 10000 where any other `io_uring_queue_init` calls (even from separate processes!) failed. It's possible there's a leak on our end, but am I pretty sure this is actually a resolved issue on the `liburing` side (https://github.com/axboe/liburing/issues/157).
