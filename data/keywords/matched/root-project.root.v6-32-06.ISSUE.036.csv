I do not have a full reproducer, however I would say:. ```cpp. int. main() {. char *foo=0;. foo[10] = 1;. }. ```. exhibits a similar behaviour when compiled with:. ```bash. c++ -fsanitize=thread foo.cc $HOME/src/sw/osx_x86-64/ROOT/latest-dev-o2/lib/libCore.so. ```. I think the thread sanitiser adds some signal handling as well and some race condition occurs. ### Setup. v6-20-08. macOS. own build.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7418
