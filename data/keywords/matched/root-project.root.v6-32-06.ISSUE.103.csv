https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14933:1346,availability,avail,available,1346,"Per RSample friend tree + option to BuildIndex; ### Feature description. Hi,. I would like to use the functionality of [RDatasetSpec](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1Experimental_1_1RDatasetSpec.html) object to setup my RDataFrame code. However, this seems to lack one crucial functionality: the option to match events from different trees using friend trees and the ""BuildIndex"" functionality. I see that the object allows to pass some global friends via ""WithGlobalFriends"" but this adds a global friend trees without the option of matching events from the trees. One would also not want to match the events between the individual samples and a global friend tree. What I would want is to have an option to define per sample a tree/tchain that would be added as a friend tree for that given sample with the option to match the events between the trees using BuildIndex or similar functionality. . What this would mean in practice is probably to add FriendInfo support for the individual RSamples. This is also what is natural for my setup (which is rather common I think) where you want to match detector level events (one TTree) and truth level events (another TTree) and this matching is different for different samples in the specification. . Please, let me know if this is a reasonable thing or there is some workaround available already. Best,.

Using `np.asarray()` to convert an existing `RVec` object into the numpy array as suggested in the Documentation [here](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1VecOps_1_1RVec.html#RVecdoxyref) takes memory which is never freed.

This has the undesirable side effect that some classes/functions will be broken:. ```. ROOT.RDataFrame(10).Define(""x"", ""1"").Snapshot(""test"", ""test.root""). ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Dask.RDataFrame(""test"", ""test.root""). ```. which will give the error. ```. AttributeError: <namespace cppyy.gbl.ROOT.Math.Internal at 0x864b200> has no attribute 'TreeUtils'. Full details:. type object 'Internal' has no attribute 'TreeUtils'. 'ROOT::Math::Internal::TreeUtils' is not a known C++ class. 'TreeUtils' is not a known C++ template. 'TreeUtils' is not a known C++ enum. ```. A temporary fix will be to override ROOT.Internal withe the correct namespace after it is changed. I am wondering if there are being ways to make sure that the classes/functions from the correct namespace are being called (in PyROOT)? ### ROOT version. 6.30/04. ### Installation method.
