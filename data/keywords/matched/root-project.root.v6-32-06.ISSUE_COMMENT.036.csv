https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7344:475,performance,optimiz,optimization,475,"Hi @hageboeck and @manolismih, thanks for you comments! Sorry for the late answer, it took me some time to come up with a better solution. Making the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware of the batchmode is the biggest challenge in this PR, as you have noticed. Like Stephan suggested, I have tried no to pass as much information as possible in the constructors to hopefully avoid some of the new member variables I introduced here. In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter. This has been a significant refactor, so I made a new PR with these changes excluding the `RunContextTracker` which we could introduce in a second step:. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7616",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7344

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361:275,deployability,version,version,275,"Hi,. the LHCb point of view on the issue is that we must be able to know which code we executed, mostly for debugging purposes (understanding why the trigger application took a specific decision counts as debugging for me). When you have an application that can decide which version of a function to run depending on something you cannot control, like the specific CPU on the Grid node or the time of the day, makes the debugging much more tricky (at some point we started storing in each event the binary id and the CPU type used for that event), so we decided that we do not want this kind of automatic dispatching: an application compiled to run on a Nehalem equivalent CPU should run only instructions valid for Nehalem processors, even if the actual CPU can do better. Our approach is that we still have some functions that have different implementations for different instructions sets (basically scalar, sse4.2 and avx2), but we chose at compile time which one to use by adding something like `-mavx2` or `-march=haswell` to the compile flags. And yes, it should be a cmake flag, but you are most welcome to have also the `ARCH=dynamic` option. OTOH you are talking about RooFit and AFAIK we do not use it in trigger, reconstruction or simulation software, but it is only used for the analysis, and there we have less constraints, as it has become common practice to use Conda based installations, so builds and versions decoupled from our production software.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361

I anyway (as a matter of principle) would prefer if you can have dynamic architecture dispatching that I can turn off in specific builds. @oshadura also mention possible optimizations in compression algorithms, but, again, that's a case that does not worry me, as they only deal with integers, so you do not get incompatible/incorrect results by changing the order of operations (unless there's a bug). The bottom line is that I'm worried about numerical instabilities due to the change of order of floating point operations in trigger and reconstruction code.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361:765,usability,prefer,prefer,765,"Your understanding is correct, you can go ahead with v6.24/00. For the compile time pinning, from the discussion we had yesterday, we can have architecture specific builds, so that, for example, `x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt` will stick to the basic `x86-64` instructions, while `haswell-centos7-gcc9-opt` will do its best using AVX2 and all other goodies you get on that platform (we can also use the microarchitecture levels like `x86-64-v2` which will be available as of GCC 11 and Clang 12). For the RooFit specific case, our analysis does not use the builds from SFT and we do not use RooFit in trigger and reconstruction (which are the cases that I'm most worried about). Let's see from somebody in ATLAS what they think.

Users that do not whish to use distributed RDataFrame may turn the new build option OFF, furthermore if the dependencies are not installed the option will be switched OFF during the build process automatically (or it will trigger a configuration error only if the option `fail-on-missing` is enabled). That said, I believe you are correct in pointing out the dependencies section of our website.

Hi @ferdymercury,. it's not a different fork, but it's llvm 9. You have to know that ROOT has to put patches on top of llvm, which sometimes should not go upstream.
