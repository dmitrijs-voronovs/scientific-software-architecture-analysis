If two processes get to the creation of the cache directory hierarchy precisely at the same time, it seems that there can still be a race there where one process fails to create the cache directory but it also doesn't see the full hierarchy already there. In that case there is no hard failure though: the process that fails to create the cache directory simply reads the file remotely rather than caching it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9479

One could maybe hack something that detects the context in which RooFit is used, but these hacks are usually fragile and I would prefer not to do it.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9490:438,usability,ERROR,ERROR,438,"@p-bhagyashree and I have found an issue related to this one, which is hinted at in the last comment on the [forum post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/cannot-access-roomcstudy-genpardataset/46724/6) that was also linked in the description of this issue. The comment mentions an error message, which we also observed (although the `prodpdf` is `simpdf` in our case):. ```. [#0] ERROR:InputArguments -- RooDataSet::merge(fitParData_prodpdf) ERROR: datasets have different size. ```. Looking through the source code, this is happening when attempting to merge the `fitParData` and `genParData`. The reason that they are different sizes seems to be because [`genParData` is added to for every experiment that is generated](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/v6-28-00/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooMCStudy.cxx#L368), while [`fitParData` is only added to if the fit succeeds](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/v6-28-00/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooMCStudy.cxx#L683). The bug could presumably be fixed therefore by delaying the append to `genParData` and again only doing so if the fit is successful.

You first scale the original histogram by the bin width to represent a density, this is fine and then you generate random number from this scaled histogram. If you doing this you the histogram represent now a density and of course you need to account of the bin width when calling`TH1::GetRandom`. If you would use the original un-scaled histogram, it would be fine. . I am afraid adding the fix that you suggest it will add some inconsistency. Maybe the way to proceed is adding in GetRandom an option to consider the bin width in case of density histograms ? Cheers.

You first scale the original histogram by the bin width to represent a density, this is fine and then you generate random number from this scaled histogram. If you doing this you the histogram represent now a density and of course you need to account of the bin width when calling`TH1::GetRandom`. If you would use the original un-scaled histogram, it would be fine. . I am afraid adding the fix that you suggest it will add some inconsistency.

Author: Juneyoung Lee <aqjune@gmail.com>. Date: Tue Feb 23 11:46:59 2021 +0900. [SimplifyCFG] Update passingValueIsAlwaysUndefined to check more attributes. This is a simple patch to update SimplifyCFG's passingValueIsAlwaysUndefined to inspect more attributes. A new function `CallBase::isPassingUndefUB` checks attributes that imply noundef.

If I remove the `return nullptr` statically in the code like. ```diff. diff --git a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h. index c5a49bd1b6..bb4afbd12d 100644. --- a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h. +++ b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h. @@ -109,9 +109,6 @@ public:. /// Return object at given index, or nullptr if index is out of range. inline RooAbsArg* at(Int_t idx) const {. - if (idx >= static_cast<Int_t>(_list.size())). - return nullptr;. -. return _list[idx];. }. ```. I see the same crash happening with GCC. What I see with a debugger is that `_pdfList` has size 2 while `_coefList` has size 1, so the second iteration of the loop passes `nullptr` for `coef`. This is ""filtered out"" later in `RooAbsArg::dependsOn` where `ignoreArg` is also `nullptr` and things magically work. So, @guitargeek, there are a number of possibilities:. 1. Modify the loop to only run until `std::min(_pdfList.size(), _coefList.size()`. 2. Add explicit `nullptr` checks for `pdf` and `coef` before calling `observableOverlaps` so the compiler cannot optimize them out",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547
