In my attempts to set the alignment differently on the first and last labels, I found only one value seemed to be set. On trying to make a minimal reproducer, I'm finding that for certain, changing the LabelFont is not working if all labels are not set correctly. ```. python. >>> import ROOT. >>> h = ROOT.TH1D(""h"", """", 5, 0, 5). >>> for bin in range(h.GetXaxis().GetNbins()+1):. ... h.GetXaxis().ChangeLabel(bin, 10*bin, 4*bin, -1, -1, -1, """"). ... >>> h.Draw().

Produced the attached axis, so the rotations are working, but a separate test suggests that alignments are not when the rotation is different than 0 (setting the rotation to 90 seems to produce identical alignment for all labels, as far as I can tell). Setting the pixel size to e.g. 10, of course, blows up those labels to greater-than-canvas size, they're being interpreted as fractions still. That is actually related to a problem I had a few days ago, accidentally passing fractional instead of integer (>1) values for size when the font precision is changed to absolute scale, but I'm not sure it's worth a warning or error message when it's being set. So, separate from the documentation: what is the appropriate way to find the number of labels? Trying to use the TAxis::GetLabels() method didn't lead me anywhere, maybe there's a good example somewhere though. <img width=""694"" alt=""ChangeLabels"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38217274/161010205-85424185-a64a-4829-992e-1982f16588d5.png"">. ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10279

Produced the attached axis, so the rotations are working, but a separate test suggests that alignments are not when the rotation is different than 0 (setting the rotation to 90 seems to produce identical alignment for all labels, as far as I can tell). Setting the pixel size to e.g. 10, of course, blows up those labels to greater-than-canvas size, they're being interpreted as fractions still. That is actually related to a problem I had a few days ago, accidentally passing fractional instead of integer (>1) values for size when the font precision is changed to absolute scale, but I'm not sure it's worth a warning or error message when it's being set. So, separate from the documentation: what is the appropriate way to find the number of labels?

Calling `.str()` is often too expensive but we may need to do it here. I think the problem is that `const char*` is convertible to `std::string_view` and `llvm::StringRef` while the latter two are convertible to each other. So the compiler in principle can do both conversions and its ambiguous which one should be preferred. Using `llvm::StringRef` in the three cases explicitly fixes the build for me:. ```diff. diff --git a/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx b/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx. index 0900c4d62a..b288aef228 100644. --- a/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx. +++ b/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx. @@ -3164,10 +3164,11 @@ Bool_t TCling::IsLoaded(const char* filename) const. llvm::StringRef(filesStr).split(files, ""\n"");. std::set<std::string> fileMap;. + llvm::StringRef file_name_ref(file_name);. // Fill fileMap; return early on exact match. for (llvm::SmallVector<llvm::StringRef, 100>::const_iterator. iF = files.begin(), iE = files.end(); iF != iE; ++iF) {. - if ((*iF) == file_name.c_str()) return kTRUE; // exact match. + if ((*iF) == file_name_ref) return kTRUE; // exact match. fileMap.insert(iF->str());. }. @@ -7116,9 +7117,12 @@ static std::string GetSharedLibImmediateDepsSlow(std::string lib,. // FIXME: It is unclear whether we can ignore all weak undefined. // symbols:. // http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-October/118177.html. - if (SymName == ""_Jv_RegisterClasses"" ||. - SymName == ""_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable"" ||. - SymName == ""_ITM_registerTMCloneTable""). + static constexpr llvm::StringRef RegisterClasses(""_Jv_RegisterClasses"");. + static constexpr llvm::StringRef RegisterCloneTable(""_ITM_registerTMCloneTable"");. + static constexpr llvm::StringRef DeregisterCloneTable(""_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable"");. + if (SymName == RegisterClasses ||. + SymName == RegisterCloneTable ||. + SymName == DeregisterCloneTable). co",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294:60,performance,failur,failures,60,"Yes, I agree that we should now focus on the remaining test failures, both in Cling and ROOT.

Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:. Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define. Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference).

In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:. Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ].

It is a long discussion, you can find more information [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D77598#inline-1057607). The idea is when we print the values of integral types, we should print them as they were written. Here is an example where this does not happen https://godbolt.org/z/MGK5s734G so this patch should be easy to upstream. > . > [4417a2c](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4417a2cd34effdc6ea59797c2d86b6ef8ca8717a) : add default template parameter to the printing. Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default? (we always needed the default parameter to be printed ... and actually in most case, we 'worked' at making sure that all the component are explicitly included (with the right spelling, i.e. for 'opaque' typedef), (see Utils/AST.cpp and the partial desugaring).

It is a long discussion, you can find more information [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D77598#inline-1057607). The idea is when we print the values of integral types, we should print them as they were written. Here is an example where this does not happen https://godbolt.org/z/MGK5s734G so this patch should be easy to upstream. > . > [4417a2c](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4417a2cd34effdc6ea59797c2d86b6ef8ca8717a) : add default template parameter to the printing. Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default? (we always needed the default parameter to be printed ... and actually in most case, we 'worked' at making sure that all the component are explicitly included (with the right spelling, i.e. for 'opaque' typedef), (see Utils/AST.cpp and the partial desugaring).

It is a long discussion, you can find more information [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D77598#inline-1057607). The idea is when we print the values of integral types, we should print them as they were written. Here is an example where this does not happen https://godbolt.org/z/MGK5s734G so this patch should be easy to upstream. > . > [4417a2c](https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4417a2cd34effdc6ea59797c2d86b6ef8ca8717a) : add default template parameter to the printing. Is `SuppressDefaultTemplateArgs` a new option? If it is not, is it new that it was set to true by default? (we always needed the default parameter to be printed ... and actually in most case, we 'worked' at making sure that all the component are explicitly included (with the right spelling, i.e. for 'opaque' typedef), (see Utils/AST.cpp and the partial desugaring). That was my take as well but without this switch we get failures like this one https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1135181954.

For `kernel1` it is `weak` and for `kernel2` it is `available_externally`. I think, because of the linkage type, the fatbinary code of the `kernel1` is registered for each following up kernel. Unfortunately, I have less experience with LLVM IR. Can you help me? I also added the whole LLVM IR of the modules and the LLVM IR for the statements `__global__ void kernel1(){}` and `__global__ void kernel2(){}` executed in cling 0.9 (LLVM 9 base). There is no linkage type. `__global__ void kernel1(){}` (LLVM 13). ```LLVM IR. ; ModuleID = 'cling-module-4'. source_filename = ""cling-module-4"". target datalayout = ""e-m:e-p270:32:32-p271:32:32-p272:64:64-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"". target triple = ""x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"". %struct.dim3 = type { i32, i32, i32 }. %struct.CUstream_st = type opaque. @0 = private unnamed_addr constant [12 x i8] c""_Z7kernel1v\00"", align 1. @1 = private constant [249 x i8] c""P\EDU\BA\01\00\10\00\E8\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\01\00\01\01H\00\00\00\A0\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00@\00\00\00\02\00\04\00#\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\15\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00//\0A// Generated by LLVM NVPTX Back-End\0A//\0A\0A.version 3.2\0A.target sm_35\0A.address_size 64\0A\0A\09// .globl\09_Z7kernel1v\0A\0A.visible .entry _Z7kernel1v()\0A{\0A\0A\0A\09ret;\0A\0A}\0A\00\00\00\00\00\00"", section "".nv_fatbin"", align 8. @__cuda_fatbin_wrapper = weak dso_local constant { i32, i32, i8*, i8* } { i32 1180844977, i32 1, i8* getelementptr inbounds ([249 x i8], [249 x i8]* @1, i64 0, i64 0), i8* ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294
