Specifically, I have numerous individual gVCF files and would like to know if DeepVariant can effectively handle the joint calling process using these gVCFs.

Does that mean if I wanted to train a new model from an existing one, it's safe to train on chr1-19 and then validate on chr20-22 on NIST data without the model ever seeing the variants there? Is it safe to use HG003 everywhere even though they are a direct relative of HG002 (whose data is used extensively in the training)? .

The nvidia-tensorrt package should not be used. It now just points to whatever the latest tensorrt version is. https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/2668. The result is that depending on when you build, you may be actually downloading different versions. The result is that the latest version requires Cuda 12 but the image has Cuda 11.

For example, `--channels XA, XB, XC`? Or another flag that could serve this sort of purpose? 2. If it is possible to do so, do the tags need to exist for all alignments, or can the model still take advantage of them when available and otherwise ignore when not present? I'm not an ML expert but think there are some model architectures that can learn/apply even with some missing features. 3.

I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. . First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes?

I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. . First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets.

I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. . First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes?

I'm very new to model training and honestly, coding, so thank you for your patience! I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. . First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes?

I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script?

First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. . Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. . Best, . Haley .

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/797:392,interoperability,specif,specify,392,"Issue testing custom model ; Hello, . I have followed along with the advanced training case study, and I believe I was successful in training a model (at least, there were no errors thrown in that step that I could see). I am using one chromosome for the training set, one for validation, and one for testing the model. I am running this remotely on a cluster using apptainer and was able to specify a gpu node for the training step. . When I went to test the model, my script at first appears to run fine, but it seems when it hits the call_variants step, it throws a warning, after which it does not fail but also does not progress--just stays stagnant. The main issue seems to be that my ""input shape and model shape do not match,"" but I'm not sure functionally what that means I need to fix or where I went wrong. Any suggestions on how to resolve this would be very much appreciated! Below is the code I used to train the model, and then to test the model, as well as the error code thrown when testing the mode. I will also attach the output file as a whole so you can see exactly where it stops. Thank you so much for any insight! . Best, . Haley .

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/797:977,performance,error,error,977,"Issue testing custom model ; Hello, . I have followed along with the advanced training case study, and I believe I was successful in training a model (at least, there were no errors thrown in that step that I could see). I am using one chromosome for the training set, one for validation, and one for testing the model. I am running this remotely on a cluster using apptainer and was able to specify a gpu node for the training step. . When I went to test the model, my script at first appears to run fine, but it seems when it hits the call_variants step, it throws a warning, after which it does not fail but also does not progress--just stays stagnant. The main issue seems to be that my ""input shape and model shape do not match,"" but I'm not sure functionally what that means I need to fix or where I went wrong.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/800:24,integrability,filter,filter,24,"How to set threshold to filter vcf files; Hello，. I have two problem about this:. 1. In a VCF file generated by DeepVariant, what does ""RefCall"" in the FILTER column represent, and should it be removed when filtering VCF files? 2.
