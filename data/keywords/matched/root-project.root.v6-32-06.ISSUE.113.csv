With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:. 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context. 2. When appropriate for the application, all staged clusters can be committed, which logically appends them to the RNTuple. This is implemented in a single critical section, which guarantees that the clusters and their entries are consecutive. Moreover, by synchronizing the second phase between multiple contexts, the application can enforce a total ordering of all contained entries at reasonable resource consumption: During the first phase, all write buffers are flushed and will be reused for the following cluster. The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets. The impact resulting from this will depend on the storage technology and the read pattern.

The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets.

With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:. 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context. 2.

This has been fixed upstream by https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/95532, but to avoid relying on a backport this commit works around the issue: The idea is that we lower the default priority of concerned constructors to make them sort correctly. ---.

(a) faster initialization. (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) . (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) . (d) less memory consumption (better memory scalability). The development for this commit was motivated from a use case in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long. to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder. BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call.

(a) faster initialization. (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) . (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) .
