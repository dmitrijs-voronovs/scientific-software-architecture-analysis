I'm not feeling comfortable changing the copied modulemaps too much, we _have_ to move to a more dynamic scheme to not break on changes by Apple, and every local modification makes this harder. So far, we ""only"" added a surrounding `std` module and removed one module that broke because of that.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16523:202,deployability,instal,installation,202,In my opinion the problem is the search order for libraries on macosx. The value of the variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK which defines the order is LAST when checking for OpenGL such that any other OpenGL installation is found before the framework one. Since the default setting is FIRST there must be a reason why this is changed. To work around the problem for OpenGL I would propose to change the setting temporarily such that the framework version of OpenGL is taken. I will prepare a fix after I am sure that this is the issue.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16523
