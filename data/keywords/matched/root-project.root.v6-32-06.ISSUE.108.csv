The construction of the column ranges is faulty in two regards:. * It uses the default initialized compression settings, which is 0, meaning there is no distinction between uncompressed columns and columns that were not compressed because they never existed on disk. * The columns belonging to subfields of backfilled fields are not properly recognized as deferred, so those column ranges are always zero-initialized. ### Reproducer. ```cpp. using ROOT::Experimental::ENTupleInfo;. using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleInspector;. using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleModel;. using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleReader;. using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleWriter;. void modelextension() {. {. auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();. auto fld = model->MakeField<float>(""fld"", 42.0);. auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ""ntuple"",.

This happens both in situations where the total number of collection elements (so the sum of elements over all fields) is less and greater than the number of entries, and this issue does not appear for non-backfilled fields (with the same types and contents). #### Apparent cause.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15686:511,modifiability,depend,depending,511,"JITted code changes the execution order of computation graph nodes; ### Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. The RDataFrame execution order for branches of the computation graph is bottom-up: actions request values to the upstream readers traversing them one by one in reverse order w.r.t. their insertion. This logic seems to be flipped when the action is JITted. In a simple example with two `Define`d columns and one `Graph`, the order of execution of the `Define`s changes depending on whether the action needs to infer the column types or not. Correc order (bottom-up). ```. ./repro_graph_compiled.out .

The RDataFrame execution order for branches of the computation graph is bottom-up: actions request values to the upstream readers traversing them one by one in reverse order w.r.t. their insertion. This logic seems to be flipped when the action is JITted. In a simple example with two `Define`d columns and one `Graph`, the order of execution of the `Define`s changes depending on whether the action needs to infer the column types or not. Correc order (bottom-up). ```. ./repro_graph_compiled.out .

It seems that `ROOTConfig.cmake` [reconfigures](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/v6-32-00/cmake/scripts/ROOTConfig.cmake.in#L148) the value of `CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES` in order to find ROOT libraries with the `lib` prefix. However, the original value is never put back. Later on, this breaks e.g. `find_library(ZLIB)`, which relies on the existence of a file called `zlib.lib` (not `libzlib.lib`). This was discussed in [another issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39099). ### Reproducer. 1. Create a hello world C++ project with cmake build system. 2. Add dependency on ROOT using `find_package(ROOT CONFIG REQUIRED)`. 3. Add dependency on ZLIB using `find_package(ZLIB REQUIRED)`. 4. Attempt to configure the project with cmake. Expected result: the project configures successfully and can be built. Actual result: the configuration fails, see [the issue referenced earlier](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39099) for detailed logs. ### ROOT version.

The `USE_BSWAPCPY` is only used if `defined(__i386__)`, i.e. on 32 bit intel only. The asm code in the `Bswapcpy.h` header seems to be intented to work for both ix86 and x86_64 though. So I don't know why it is only used for ix86 here. I have worked around this by replacing linr 40-41 with `#if 0`, i.e. not using the asm code on ix86 either, which gets rid of the crash. I didn't mak a PR of this change because I don't know if this is the preferred way to fix it. ### Reproducer. Build ROOT 6.32.00 on ix86. ### ROOT version. 6.32.00. ### Installation method.

The `USE_BSWAPCPY` is only used if `defined(__i386__)`, i.e. on 32 bit intel only. The asm code in the `Bswapcpy.h` header seems to be intented to work for both ix86 and x86_64 though. So I don't know why it is only used for ix86 here. I have worked around this by replacing linr 40-41 with `#if 0`, i.e. not using the asm code on ix86 either, which gets rid of the crash. I didn't mak a PR of this change because I don't know if this is the preferred way to fix it. ### Reproducer. Build ROOT 6.32.00 on ix86. ### ROOT version. 6.32.00. ### Installation method.

The `USE_BSWAPCPY` is only used if `defined(__i386__)`, i.e. on 32 bit intel only. The asm code in the `Bswapcpy.h` header seems to be intented to work for both ix86 and x86_64 though.

This option can be set to write to either TTree, RNTuple, or take the default choice. The table below describes how `Snapshot` behaves accoring to the output format option:. | | From TTree | From RNTuple | From other DS |. | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |. | **To TTree** | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kTTree` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` |. | **To RNTuple** | Not yet possible, will be added in a follow-up, using functionality from `RNTupleImporter` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kRNTuple` |. ## Implementation. As mentioned, the existing `Snapshot` interface is used. A new `SnapshotRNTupleHelper` has been created to handle the creation and writing of the RNTuple, akin to the existing `SnapshotHelper` (which has been renamed to `SnapshotTTreeHelper` for consistency). ### RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f). The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. ### Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02). For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`. To avoid dependency conflicts related to including `ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx`, the free `FromRNTuple` functions have been moved to a separate header. ## Current limitations and follow-ups.

However, RNTuple's default compression setting is 505 (zstd). We could change the default compression setting to `kInherit` and decide which settings to use according to the target data format (unless explicitly set by the user, of course). ### Multithreaded snapshotting. This PR only adds single-threaded RNTuple snapshotting. Multithreaded (and parallel) snapshotting will be addressed in a follow-up PR. ## Tests. Corresponding `roottest` PR: https://github.com/root-project/roottest/pull/1178.

We could change the default compression setting to `kInherit` and decide which settings to use according to the target data format (unless explicitly set by the user, of course). ### Multithreaded snapshotting.

Using a conditional RooProdPdf in a RooSimultaneous spawns too many integrals with new CPU evaluation backend. This is a deal breaker for fitting the open likelihood of the CMS Run 1 Higgs analysis with the new CPU evaluation backend, because evaluating these unnecessary integrals takes too much time (although the result is correct). Since the RooFit AD backend uses the same ""`compileForNormSet`"" method to sanitize the computation graph, it's also a blocker for minimizing the CMS Higgs Run 1 likelihood with AD. ### Reproducer. ```c++.

Using a conditional RooProdPdf in a RooSimultaneous spawns too many integrals with new CPU evaluation backend. This is a deal breaker for fitting the open likelihood of the CMS Run 1 Higgs analysis with the new CPU evaluation backend, because evaluating these unnecessary integrals takes too much time (although the result is correct).

Using a conditional RooProdPdf in a RooSimultaneous spawns too many integrals with new CPU evaluation backend. This is a deal breaker for fitting the open likelihood of the CMS Run 1 Higgs analysis with the new CPU evaluation backend, because evaluating these unnecessary integrals takes too much time (although the result is correct). Since the RooFit AD backend uses the same ""`compileForNormSet`"" method to sanitize the computation graph, it's also a blocker for minimizing the CMS Higgs Run 1 likelihood with AD. ### Reproducer. ```c++.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15751:601,usability,minim,minimizing,601,"[RF] Using a conditional RooProdPdf in a multi-channel fit spawns too many integrals with new CPU evaluation backend; ### Description. Using a conditional RooProdPdf in a RooSimultaneous spawns too many integrals with new CPU evaluation backend. This is a deal breaker for fitting the open likelihood of the CMS Run 1 Higgs analysis with the new CPU evaluation backend, because evaluating these unnecessary integrals takes too much time (although the result is correct). Since the RooFit AD backend uses the same ""`compileForNormSet`"" method to sanitize the computation graph, it's also a blocker for minimizing the CMS Higgs Run 1 likelihood with AD. ### Reproducer. ```c++. RooRealVar x{""x"", ""x"", 0, 1};. RooRealVar y{""y"", ""y"", 0, 1};. RooGenericPdf pdfx{""pdfx"", ""1.0 + x - x"", {x}};. RooGenericPdf pdfxy{""pdfxy"", ""1.0 + x - x + y - y"", {x, y}};.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15774:16,deployability,version,version,16,"[ci] Add Python version to Windows precomplied release title or filename; ### Explain what you would like to see improved and how. When installing ROOT in Windows from precompiled release section [on the web](https://root.cern/releases/release-63200/), it's said that one has to use the same Visual Studio and Python version in the system than the one used for compiling. The Visual Studio version (2022) is part of the title and (vc17) is part of the filename. The same is not true for the Python version. It would be great if this could be added. For example, what Python version should be downloaded for v6.32.00 ? It's 3.11 but you need to find it out the hard way. Thanks in advance!! ### ROOT version. ```. ROOT v6.32.00.
