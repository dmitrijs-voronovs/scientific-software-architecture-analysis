Just to clarify, are you referring to the QUAL field of the VCF (the 6th column of tab-file itself), or the GQ field (the 10th column of a single sample). If you are referring to QUAL as the 6th column, this observation is expected. QUAL measures the probability that the ALT field has at least one allele with the ALT base. So you can think of it as p(HET) + p(HOM), or alternatively as 1 - p(REF). For homozygous positions, they look more clearly non-reference as in many cases they may not have any reference bases. . Heterozygous positions likely have at least some evidence for the Ref allele, which suggests a higher probability that the position might be Ref. If you are interested in filtering, we often recommend that the GQ field in the samples is preferable, as this is a measure of the genotype call itself being correct. There may be some differences between HET and HOM for this due to differences in difficulty in making those types of calls. However, it should be lower.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/547

We're in a bit of a time crunch now (operations), but knowing how to run that experiment will be super helpful! @amwenger . Right, `pbmm2` (used in our pipeline) doesn't provide the `BQ:Z` tag. However, we also run `samtools calmd` on the BAM to generate the `MD:Z` tag. And `calmd` allows one to compute the BAQ by turning on the `-r` flag (off in our pipeline now). But as you can imagine, it will not be negligible compute. Hence we are interested in doing some experiments to see if DV can benefit from this tag.

As a hypothetical example, to use `insert_size` + `allele_frequency` + `avg_base_quality` during variant calling would require re-training, correct? Yes.

But, if you're using an older model (such as the AF model you're using), and if it didn't have a `model.ckpt.example_info.json` file with it, then I believe the current behavior is that it will try to use the 7 channels directly.

My answer to your question will depend on what exactly you will need from Plink and what sort of cohort approach you have. . If you just want to be able to run Plink on the joint genotype results, I wonder if you can try following the process which was performed for UKBiobank to convert their DeepVariant exome joint calls into PLINK format. That is the section **Conversion of pVCF to PLINK and BGEN files** [from the UKBiobank WES Protocol](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/ukb/docs/UKB_WES_Protocol.pdf). I hope this will work, as it is not generally our preference to replicate the functionality of -ERC BP_RESOLUTION, and this is likely to make writing output much slower. If, instead, you want calls at specific sites (similar to a genotyping chip approach but with NGS data), I would say that is is possible to force genotyping at a given set of alleles with one of the modules of DeepVariant (VCF candidate importer).

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/572:688,energy efficiency,model,model,688,"Hi @FarmOmics ,. The `--model_type=WES` is a shorthand specifically for the wrapper script ""run_deepvariant.py"". Specifically here. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/scripts/run_deepvariant.py#L236-L239. In https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/docs/deepvariant-rnaseq-case-study.md , you'll see that the RNAseq run actually overwrites these arguments:. with:. ```. --make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true,channels=''"" \. ```. which basically means: If you run `make_examples` on your own (without using the wrapper script ""run_deepvariant.py""), you'll want to provide `--split_skip_reads=true`, but not providing `channels`. And we also provided RNAseq model with:. ```. --customized_model=model/model.ckpt \. ```.

One thing I want to mention is that this distribution is something that we have seen in some samples - see Figure 1 of [Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/24/5582/6064144). In this figure, some of the analyzed cohorts do have bimodal GQ distributions for DeepVariant calls, while others (e.g. GIAB) do not. Supplementary Figure 3 of that paper indicates that a reasonable component of the bimodal distribution relates to sequence depth, at lower sample sequence depths, GIAB becomes more bimodal. I believe that we internally stratified calls and (though my memory is hazy) found that another factor in the bimodal distribution is whether a site is HET or HOM. Specifically, HET sites with lower depth have lower GQs, and I believe the explanation for this is that as coverage drops, it can become difficult to tell a HET site from either a REF or HOM, while HOM sites have more effective signal for them as non-REF. I don't think that the model is likely to be less confident in 100bp reads because they are not as much of the training data, but I expect the fact that 100bp reads are harder to uniquely map and will results in more variability in the coverage of high-MAPQ reads would indirectly contribute. .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586

In this figure, some of the analyzed cohorts do have bimodal GQ distributions for DeepVariant calls, while others (e.g. GIAB) do not. Supplementary Figure 3 of that paper indicates that a reasonable component of the bimodal distribution relates to sequence depth, at lower sample sequence depths, GIAB becomes more bimodal. I believe that we internally stratified calls and (though my memory is hazy) found that another factor in the bimodal distribution is whether a site is HET or HOM. Specifically, HET sites with lower depth have lower GQs, and I believe the explanation for this is that as coverage drops, it can become difficult to tell a HET site from either a REF or HOM, while HOM sites have more effective signal for them as non-REF. I don't think that the model is likely to be less confident in 100bp reads because they are not as much of the training data, but I expect the fact that 100bp reads are harder to uniquely map and will results in more variability in the coverage of high-MAPQ reads would indirectly contribute. .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586
