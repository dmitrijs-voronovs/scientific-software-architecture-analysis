https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409:752,reliability,availab,available,752,"[RF] Refactor CUDA code in RooFit; This is done to better separate CUDA-specific code from the generic code. in RooBatchCompute. Two problems are addressed in this commit:. 1. The RooBatchCompute library had too many CUDA specific functions. The virtual RooBatchCompute interface should be backend agnostic, but. it had CUDA specific functions like `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`,. which where only implemented in the CUDA case. So an abstraction. didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics. to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library. are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor. macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. These types are only. available to `nvcc`, and in case gcc is used, these were forward. declared as stucts. This is a hack that should be avoided. In. particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the. same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,. and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function. should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`. directly. This parameter is removed. Now, the CUDA stream is stored. in a `RooBatchCompute::Config` struct that is passed around in the. `DataMap`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409

ATLAS is seeing a number of unit test failures in the dev4LCG/el9 nightlies. (which use root-6.28.00-patches). that are linked to trying to operate on Eigen objects from pyroot. I've managed to reduce this to a simple, standalone example, which reveals. that the issue has to do with a template overload for operator(). The reproducer is in the attached archive. The included setup script. should be appropriate for lxplus9. Run:. $ . ./setup. $ ./build.sh. $ python test.py. and it crashes with a segmentation violation.

ATLAS is seeing a number of unit test failures in the dev4LCG/el9 nightlies. (which use root-6.28.00-patches). that are linked to trying to operate on Eigen objects from pyroot. I've managed to reduce this to a simple, standalone example, which reveals. that the issue has to do with a template overload for operator(). The reproducer is in the attached archive. The included setup script. should be appropriate for lxplus9. Run:. $ . ./setup. $ ./build.sh. $ python test.py. and it crashes with a segmentation violation. From gdb, the stack trace is:. ```. #0 0x00007ffff7558f13 in std::construct_at<CPyCppyy::PyCallable*, CPyCppyy::PyCallable* const&> (__location=0x5f3a3a676e697274). at /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/gcc/13.1.0-b3d18/x86_64-el9/include/c++/13.1.0/bits/stl_construct.h:97. #1 0x00007ffff75588c3 in std::allocator_traits<std::allocator<CPyCppyy::PyCallable*> >::construct<CPyCppyy::PyCallable*, CPyCppyy::PyCallable* const&> (. __p=0x5f3a3a676e697274, __a=...). at /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/gcc/13.1.0-b3d18/x86_64-el9/include/c++/13.1.0/bits/alloc_traits.h:539. #2 std::vector<CPyCppyy::PyCallable*, std::allocator<CPyCppyy::PyCallable*> >::push_back (this=0x7ffff75ba167, __x=@0x7fffffff7c40: 0x73abec0). at /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/gcc/13.1.0-b3d18/x86_64-el9/include/c++/13.1.0/bits/stl_vector.h:1281. #3 0x00007ffff75624a9 in CPyCppyy::CPPOverload::AdoptMethod (. this=0x7ffff75fe9a0 <CPyCppyy::TemplateProxy_Type>, pc=0x73abec0). at /build/jenkins/workspace/lcg_nightly_pipeline/build/projects/ROOT-v6-28-00-patches/src/ROOT/v6-28-00-patches/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/CPyCppyy/src/CPPOverload.cxx:946. #4 0x00007ffff759fb6a in CPyCppyy::TemplateProxy::AdoptMethod (. this=0x7fffd65c01f0, pc=0x73abec0). at /build/jenkins/workspace/lcg_nightly_pipeline/build/projects/ROOT-v6-28-00-patches/src/ROOT/v6-28-00-patches/bindings/pyroo",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13410

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13418:466,availability,avail,available,466,"clip edit in GL viewer is still broken; ### Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Hello,. It looks like #13081 is closed, but the problem is still there. I compiled root from today's head of the master branch, c15efc8fb313595a018245f112adf3f30c014776. The only difference from my earlier report is that one needs to use the --web=off switch to the command line to make the image appear in the GL viewer window (where the box clip is available) instead of a browser window (which does not even have the box clip). Once the ""edit in viewer"" option is checked, the clip box can be moved with the mouse, but still only along one axis, not along the other two. This issue may be specific to the newest version of Alma Linux. Andrei. ### Reproducer. To reproduce: run. $ root --web=off $ROOTSYS/tutorials/geom/building.C. - in the GL window, click on the ""Clipping"" tab. - click ""Box"". - check ""Edit in Viewer"". - rotate to make the three clip box axes visible. - try to move the clip box along the axes.

Hello,. It looks like #13081 is closed, but the problem is still there. I compiled root from today's head of the master branch, c15efc8fb313595a018245f112adf3f30c014776. The only difference from my earlier report is that one needs to use the --web=off switch to the command line to make the image appear in the GL viewer window (where the box clip is available) instead of a browser window (which does not even have the box clip). Once the ""edit in viewer"" option is checked, the clip box can be moved with the mouse, but still only along one axis, not along the other two. This issue may be specific to the newest version of Alma Linux. Andrei. ### Reproducer. To reproduce: run. $ root --web=off $ROOTSYS/tutorials/geom/building.C. - in the GL window, click on the ""Clipping"" tab. - click ""Box"". - check ""Edit in Viewer"". - rotate to make the three clip box axes visible. - try to move the clip box along the axes.

Hello,. It looks like #13081 is closed, but the problem is still there. I compiled root from today's head of the master branch, c15efc8fb313595a018245f112adf3f30c014776. The only difference from my earlier report is that one needs to use the --web=off switch to the command line to make the image appear in the GL viewer window (where the box clip is available) instead of a browser window (which does not even have the box clip). Once the ""edit in viewer"" option is checked, the clip box can be moved with the mouse, but still only along one axis, not along the other two. This issue may be specific to the newest version of Alma Linux. Andrei. ### Reproducer. To reproduce: run. $ root --web=off $ROOTSYS/tutorials/geom/building.C. - in the GL window, click on the ""Clipping"" tab. - click ""Box"". - check ""Edit in Viewer"". - rotate to make the three clip box axes visible. - try to move the clip box along the axes.

Autoloading via the TCling::AutoLoad generally works very well, always exhibiting the same behaviour. However, sometimes it fails, for example when a symbol is in a library linked to a pcm which is not yet loaded. This is due to the fact that ROOT ultimately figures out which libraries to load based on the pcm linked to a certain class (scope to precisely use the Clang nomenclature). This happens because TCling::AutoLoad temporarily suppresses parsing: the lookup done by cling for a certain scope is doomed to fail if the pcm where the scope is defined is not loaded already. ### Reproducer. `root -b -q -l -e ""gInterpreter->AutoLoad(\""RooGaussian\"")""` . returns 0 (unhappiness) . ```. root [0] gInterpreter->AutoLoad(""RooGaussian"").

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13432:245,usability,behavi,behaviour,245,"TCling::AutoLoad may not work if a pcm linked to the library is not preloaded; ### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Autoloading via the TCling::AutoLoad generally works very well, always exhibiting the same behaviour. However, sometimes it fails, for example when a symbol is in a library linked to a pcm which is not yet loaded. This is due to the fact that ROOT ultimately figures out which libraries to load based on the pcm linked to a certain class (scope to precisely use the Clang nomenclature). This happens because TCling::AutoLoad temporarily suppresses parsing: the lookup done by cling for a certain scope is doomed to fail if the pcm where the scope is defined is not loaded already. ### Reproducer. `root -b -q -l -e ""gInterpreter->AutoLoad(\""RooGaussian\"")""` . returns 0 (unhappiness) . ```. root [0] gInterpreter->AutoLoad(""RooGaussian""). (int) 1. ```. as the snippet shows, returns 1 (happiness).

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13487:1713,usability,simpl,simple,1713,"[ntuple] Move `R__ASSERT` out of the inlined code path; As measured, there is an improvement if the expansion of `R__ASSERT()` is out of the inlined code path due to slighly more compact code. Additionally, the `R__ASSERT(count > 0)` has been removed, given that `ClusterSize_t::ValueType` is an unsigned integral type. This was seen during the evaluation of the relative overhead of RField's post-read callbacks, which for reference I provide below. Two different tests were carried out: _(i)_ 4 fields of type `std::uint32_t`; and _(ii)_ 2 fields of type `std::uint32_t` + 2 fields of a user-defined struct, where:. - BASE refers to the current `master` with `RFieldBase::Read()` slightly changed to not support read callbacks. - [1] refers to the current `master` + the changes in this PR. - [2] refers to the current `master` where `RFieldBase::InvokeReadCallbacks()` is also outlined by moving it to RField.cxx. All tests used a Release `-O3` build, 40M entries and 505 compression; results in $us$, averaged over 10 executions. _(i)_ 4 fields of type `std::uint32_t`:. ```. | Average | Rel. increase. ---------------------------+-----------+--------------.
